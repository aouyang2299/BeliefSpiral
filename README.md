# BeliefSpiral

We created the Belief Graph Explorer, an interactive tool that allows users to explore how different beliefs are interconnected through a dynamic visual graph interface. Built on a foundation of real-world data extracted from news articles, social media discussions, and Wikipedia entries, the Explorer maps out how various ideas, conspiracies, and topics cluster together based on conceptual similarity and co-occurrence. Users can input a belief, instantly see a web of related ideas, and continue clicking deeper, much like falling down an information "rabbit hole." The tool emphasizes how beliefs are not isolated, but rather exist within complex networks that can lead users from familiar concepts into more extreme or unexpected territories. By making the navigation intuitive and exploratory, the Belief Graph Explorer offers a playful yet revealing way to experience the architecture of information ecosystems, reflecting the very real ways that exposure to related content can shape, reinforce, or even radicalize perspectives over time.
