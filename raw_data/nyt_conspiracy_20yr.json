    "content": "It is now perfectly reasonable, for instance, to believe that a novel virus that killed more than 20 million people worldwide and upended for years the daily life of billions was engineered by scientists and then released by accident, with a global cover-up improvised in the months that followed. To me, it is probably fair to call this a campaign of information suppression, but it does not appear to have been especially effective, since as early as May 2020, at roughly the peak of that censorship, nearly half of Americans believed the Covid virus had come out of a lab. But over time, the lab-leak theory of pandemic origins has grown even closer to consensus, and not just in America; the German spy agency, for instance, now believes that the virus probably came out of a lab — a view broadly in line with the views of American intelligence."

Donald J. Trump @realDonaldTrump americanthinker.com/blog/2024/... www.americanthinker.com The real reason Boeing is in the news In short, China wants Boeing out.

    "content": "The age of info insanity is upon us, and really weird claims are all the rage. Some have been saying Trump faked his coronavirus diagnosis because he’s about to round up an imaginary satanic pedophilia cabal. “Let’s get into the conversation of President Donald Trump supposedly having coronavirus— ‘supposedly’ being the operative word there.” Others are speculating that Joe Biden was wearing a wire in the debates. “There it is. Biden’s wearing a wire.” It’s actually just a crease in his shirt. And a popular meme among teens was the claim that Wayfair is shipping children in industrial-grade cabinets. I just have a lot of questions here. The main driver of info insanity is something called QAnon, which is where stories like these originate or are amplified. “I have grown to fully trust Don, master of all masters. He is a genius, a 5D chess player, a man with a huge heart.” He was an unknown person who claims to be an intelligence insider but obviously isn’t. And Anons are the people who follow him and decode his vague posts. The main gist of QAnon is that elite satanic pedophiles are everywhere and they’re coming to get your kids. More specifically, pedophiles are everywhere among liberals, celebrities, and the media. Meanwhile, Donald Trump is busy plotting to round them all up. “Why is it that all these pedophiles were allowed to be untouched for years and years and years until President Trump was sworn in as president?” The scale of QAnon isn’t yet clear, but it’s definitely big. It’s reached the crucial ‘your mom has heard of it’ stage. “Q is the best thing that has ever happened to me.” There are now 87 QAnon supporters who have run for Congress, and the first will be elected this November. “I think it’s something worth listening to and paying attention to.” And Trump refuses to push back against QAnon because QAnon loves Trump. “Well, I don’t know much about the movement, other than I understand they like me very much.” QAnon is serious, and it merits our attention and our concern. We need to respond. It’s tempting to just laugh all this off. But in this video, I’m going to show you why that is actually one of the worst things you can do. To understand QAnon, it helps to understand magic. I don’t mean this kind. I mean the medieval stuff. Throughout history, people believed in spells and superstitions and, yeah, religions. Magical thinking is driven by spotting patterns and creating connections. A black cat crossed your path, then your daughter fell ill— presto, look out for black cats. This is how Anons are interpreting reality. They’re thinking magically. They’re seeing patterns and drawing connections. “So there we have a connection between The Grateful Dead and the mystery schools of Egypt, ancient Egypt.” One of the major reasons QAnon is on the rise right now is because when the world is scary and uncertain, we are drawn to magical thinking. We now have a major schism between two tribes, magical thinkers and evidence seekers. The rest of us, the evidence seekers, are still plenty irrational and magical, but we mostly defer to science and empiricism. We are two tribes making sense of the world in different ways and perceiving different realities. QAnon has an indifference or outright hostility towards reality that to us evidence seekers is shocking or baffling or hilarious or infuriating. “What if I told you that those who are corrupting the world, poisoning our food, and igniting conflict were themselves about to be permanently eradicated from the Earth?” So how do we evidence seekers respond? Often with ridicule. “So I dived deep into the rabbit hole to talk to four prominent QAnon researchers.” “Donald Trump is one of the most intelligent men probably in our lifetime— like, top five, believe it or not.” “I find it hard.” We mock. We belittle. We dunk on them. It’s fun. It’s entertaining. It feels fantastic. “Boring!” Ridicule is a booming industry in Trump-era America. “I’m no psychiatrist, but I think it’s safe to say—” “This guy’s got some big issues.” There’s even an anti-QAnon community of influencers and podcasters and YouTubers dunking on QAnon all day every day. Many of them seem to love this stuff the way that other people love awful movies. It’s so bad, it’s good. “Not the bees!” Creators like these are funny and smart and, generally speaking, right. In a lot of ways, ridicule works. It’s a peaceful weapon against the powerful. It persuades people who haven’t chosen sides yet. And it demonstrates to those already on your side that your team is the smartest and wittiest and most wonderful of all. Ridicule is part of society’s immune system. Just like your body’s immune system fights a viral invader, ridicule attacks nonsense and drives it back to the fringes. Or, at least, it tries. “Where we go on, we go off. God bless, patriots.” But where ridicule falls entirely flat is at bringing people back who do believe in QAnon. Instead, ridicule leaves in its wake shame, anger, resentment, and in the worst cases, humiliation. We underestimate the power of this emotion. If someone humiliates us, we will hold that grudge indefinitely, and we will get our revenge. I think we all learned this from The Karate Kid. What role has the judgment and condescension of college-educated urbanites played in spawning QAnon? How big a factor is humiliation in the rise of Donald Trump? And if you think you’re above being targeted with ridicule, if you think you’re beyond the reach of humiliation, allow me a brief demonstration. Maybe you think Donald Trump engineered some brilliant covert conspiracy with Russia despite not being able to keep anything else secret. “We are actually about to find out if Russia maybe has something on the new president.” Maybe you think JFK was taken out by the FBI or the CIA or the military industrial complex. “I think most Americans would agree that it was not a lone gunman. That’s the conspiracy in the Warren Report.” Actually, this guy definitely did it all by himself. Maybe you believe in anarchism, which has never worked anywhere ever and spectacularly explodes in all experiments. If you believe any of these things, you might have just felt the sting of ridicule. That’s the feeling we give others when we ridicule them. Did it make you rethink your positions? Not unless you were already rethinking them. More likely, you doubled down. You got to work figuring out why I’m an idiot. Maybe you even started plotting your revenge, like a mean tweet. We all believe goofy stuff. We go to great lengths to avoid admitting being wrong, because it’s embarrassing. And when you’re really, really, really wrong, it’s humiliating. “Why are they not in jail? Oh, is it because you’re part of them? Are you part of the deep state?” “Thank you, ma’am. Your time has expired.” “The deep state is going down, and if any of you are in the deep state, you’re going down with it.” “Ma’am, this is your last warning. I’m finding that you are disrupting this meeting.” The bad news is, regardless of what happens with this guy, QAnon is still going to be here. And while most platforms have cracked down on Q, Anons are clever at evading these measures. QAnon may very well grow and even get uglier in the years ahead. So if we can’t dunk on fools, what do we do? What society as a whole does about QAnon is a complex question that has no definite answer. But what we as individuals do about Q in our personal lives is relatively simple. We don’t panic, and we don’t lash out. We calm down and we slow down. Here are three things to do if someone you know gets into QAnon. These are based on the work of Mick West, who has been debunking conspiracy theories for 15 years. Stay connected. For almost everyone, it’s not necessary to cut off a Q believer. If you do this, that’s one less lifeline back to reality they have access to. That’s one less voice that isn’t simply cheering them on. Share information they may be lacking. When you see someone posting incorrect information, share links that show why it’s incorrect and simply ask questions about how these conspiratorial claims would work. Often, when people delve a bit deeper, they can see for themselves when something is implausible. And finally, be patient. These beliefs are unlikely to suddenly vanish. It will seem like nothing is working when slow progress is actually being made. If you intervene, you need to be gentle. Be kind or be neutral. And if you can’t do either, do nothing, because your attacks can make things worse. Believers in QAnon will benefit more from our interest and our respect than from our condemnation. “Calling it stupid, calling the people who are involved in it stupid— and I’ve never known a good way to get people to do anything for me by calling them stupid.” Instead of looking at QAnon followers as a force to be defeated, look at them as fellow flawed humans you can positively influence. This isn’t some contest you need to win. Anons are just people like us. They’re not mentally ill. They’re not beyond redemption. The most formidable adversary QAnon might ultimately face is QAnon. This is a narrative that is not built to last. It’s premised on predictions that never materialize. Any and all outlandish claims are accepted. Dissent is not tolerated. There is no objective reality. And everything is interpreted. QAnon will always be an incoherent mess of nonsense. These are gigantic faults. And for many Q followers, they will become obvious in time. And the Q Show is still in its early seasons. People will also simply get bored. In the meantime, we need to endure and not chase people deeper down the rabbit hole. [MUSIC PLAYING]"

    "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/07/us/politics/alex-jones-business-infowars-conspiracy.html",
    "content": "“You’ll never —” For talk show host Alex Jones, the revolution starts not with a bang, or a whimper, but with Tangy Tangerine. “You know, many revolutionaries rob banks and things, and kidnap people for funds. We promote in the free market the products we use that are about preparedness. That’s how we fund this revolution against the new world order.” Like a burly carnival barker, he once boasted that Tangy Tangerine weight loss supplements allowed him to shed 37 pounds in just two months. It’s just one of the products Jones has hawked in the past to fund his media empire, Infowars, and to bankroll his, at times, lavish lifestyle. Today, he sells a number of items, ranging from freeze dryers to so-called testosterone boosters for men in need of a little something extra to fight the globalist agenda. And don’t forget the fish oil. “You ever seen fish oil look like that — no, you’ve never seen that, have you? Just like our information is dynamite, so are our products, infowarsstore.com.” In 2014, Jones’s business had revenues of more than $20 million. What’s made Jones a millionaire is his ability to merge his bizarre claims with his merchandise. The apocalypse requires products that the Infowars store can readily supply. His customers buy in, and then they buy. “The globalists, obviously, are hitting us through our water. It’s time to take control of our lives. It’s time to not give our children and families these poisons.” Jones touts the coming Armageddon. Conveniently, he also sells body armor and components for homemade guns. “You’ve pissed in the face of the globalists that don’t want us to be able to defend ourselves. You’ve supported the infowar. You basically have made America great again, so thank you all for your support. Limited editions available right now.” Jones, and others who help peddle his products, like chiropractor Edward Group, accuse the government of putting fluoride in drinking water, knowing it was a deadly poison. “Dumbing the population down, you’re easily controllable, and they can also —” “They’re cutting us off from higher consciousness.” And thus, Jones will sell you fluoride-free toothpaste laced with counteractive iodine. If the struggle against the ‘deep state’ is getting you down — “I can’t handle it anymore.” — there’s Super Male Vitality for aging men. “With Dr. Group’s help, we have developed the ultimate male vitality supplement. This is the answer to the globalist war on male vitality with the estrogen mimickers they’ve added to the food and the water supply.” “Oh, my God!” But all that prowess comes at a cost. “Shut this down! This is not safe!” Documents show Jones has sold at a 20 percent markup. Where he bought it for around $15, he sells it for around $70. (On sale now.) The millions of dollars his fans have spent on his products have made Jones a wealthy man. But his vitriolic rhetoric — “… have their battle rifles and everything ready at their bedsides.” — and crackpot theories, like that the Sandy Hook school shooting was a hoax, have gotten him kicked off of Facebook and YouTube and resulted in various lawsuits. Most recently, Twitter has permanently banned Jones and Infowars for violating their abusive behavior policy. Despite these setbacks, Jones continues to seethe against the machine, presumably not without the help of his survival shield formula."

    "content": "“I’d like to begin by reading a statement from the president. ‘I’ve decided to revoke the security clearance of John Brennan, former director of the Central Intelligence Agency. At this point in my administration, any benefits that senior officials might glean from consultations with Mr. Brennan are now outweighed by the risks posed by his erratic conduct and behavior.’” President Trump has taken away John Brennan’s security clearance and says he’s considering doing the same to other former national security officials. That’s even though two of the officials, including the former F.B.I. director James Comey, no longer have clearances. So why did he single out the group? One clue may be what they’ve said about him. “I think he has demonstrated time and time again that he lies to the American people, and that he is not fulfilling the responsibilities of the office of the presidency.” “The United States used to be the defender of our European allies and to push back against the Russians. The fact now that Mr. Trump is aligning himself with Mr. Putin is a concern.” “He is giving aid and comfort to the enemy, and it needs to stop.” “Oh, I have no confidence in a guy like Brennan. And I think he’s a total lowlife. “When the president tries to use the Department of Justice as kind of a private investigatory body, that’s, uh, not good for the country.” “Our institutions are under assault internally.” “Internally from the president?” “Exactly.” “Are you questioning his fitness?” “Yes, I do.” “I have no confidence in Clapper. You know, Clapper wrote me a beautiful letter when I first went to office, and it was really nice. And then all of a sudden, he’s gone haywire.” “He has a habit of telling lies. Sometimes big. Sometimes casual. And then insisting that the people around him repeat them and believe them. And that is — that stains any human.” “Is Donald Trump unfit to be president?” “Yes. I think he’s morally unfit to be president.” “I think that James Comey was unfair to the people of this country. I think what he did was a disgrace. I think he goes down as the worst F.B.I. director in history, by far. There’s nobody close. And I think I did the country a tremendous favor by firing him.”"

Day’s character, who is working in a corporate mailroom, has convinced himself that half of the company’s employees don’t exist, even as a friend assures him that not only are they real, but also that “they have been asking for their mail on a daily basis.” Rather than deal with the complex reality of his duties, he has retreated into fantasy."

As part of his plea, Mr. Paltzer agreed to forfeit any fees he earned and cooperate with the United States government. “His cooperation is complete and without any limitation,” Thomas Ostrander, Mr. Paltzer’s lawyer, said after the hearing.

The Supreme Court, which heard oral argument on this case last week, should reverse the conspiracy convictions on the ground that they violate Mr. Smith’s Fifth Amendment right to due process."

The police originally said officers had gone to the home of the woman, Kathryn Johnston, in northwest Atlanta, in 2006 after an informant said he had bought drugs there. But after finding none, officers tried to cover up the mistake by planting bags of marijuana, prosecutors said. In May, Mr. Tesler, 42, was sentenced to four and a half years in prison for lying to investigators, but federal prosecutors decided to pursue more charges after reviewing the case."

But “Blacklisted by History” is drawing significant attention on the political right, where the reviews have ranged from gushing (The Weekly Standard) to scathing (National Review).

Kennedy was working the phones, looking for answers to how his brother had died. “There’s so much bitterness,” he told a colleague that day. “I thought they would get one of us.” But who were “they”? Robert Kennedy gravitated immediately to a shadowy nexus of forces he believed were at odds with the policies of his brother’s administration. Was it the C.I.A.? he asked John McCone, the director of central intelligence. Was the assassination the work of anti-Castro Cubans? Was it the American Mafia? Or was it — since there were hidden but important connections among these groups — a combined effort by them all? Before he had ever heard the name Lee Harvey Oswald, Robert Kennedy was considering scenarios that would eventually become the foundation of the myriad conspiracy theories that have haunted the American imagination for more than 40 years; according to David Talbot, he continued to explore those scenarios until his own death in 1968, even while publicly denying his belief in a conspiracy."

It was, in tone, half trade show, half political convention. There were talks on the Reichstag fire and the sinking of the Battleship Maine as precedents for 9/11. There were speeches by the lawyer for James Earl Ray, who claimed that a military conspiracy killed the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, and by a former operative for the British secret service, MI5."
