      "FYI this is not actually how wealthy people avoid paying taxes. There are much simpler, less risky ways to get out of taxes for the wealthy. \n\nThe grain of truth here is that wealthy people do collect as patrons groups of artists who they then promote among their well connected circles with the hopes that one of the artists will become a big name. \n\nMany wealthy people view collecting art as a relatively stable way of investing as a hobby. The thinking, simplified, is that once you buy a painting, you have assigned that painting a value of whatever you paid for it. Worst case, you could re-sell it for about the same price later on, or simply enjoy the piece for what it is. But like housing, the expected trajectory is that as an artist becomes more famous via promotion from benefactors, the value of the  art will only go up. \n\nAnd largely, this seems to bear out to be true. Collecting art is at worst a break even sport for most wealthy people.",
      "The IRS allows you to deduct contributions up to 50% of your adjusted gross income (AGI) for the year.

This, as presented is not one of those methods.",
      "This wouldn’t work. First, charitable donations deductions are limited to 50% of income. Second, IRS pub 561 outlines very specific rules for determining the value of art. If you paid an artist $25k for a painting and suddenly it was valued at 20 million, the IRS requires an explanation of the increase in value. And for donations of art over $50k, you need to pay the IRS a fee, and get an appraisal from a qualified appraiser that is approved by the IRS. Such an obvious fraud scheme would generate many flags for the IRS.",
      "Also jewelry. Rich people can buy art and jewelry, take it back to whatever country they need to, and resell it or whatever. \n\nEasy way to get around claiming $10k in cash at customs. \n\nThis isn't a conspiracy, it's literally what happens.",

It had its own wall.\n\nDefinitely helped that we had kind bud left over from Amsterdam. Nevertheless, I kept telling the GF to come into the other room and look at this shit, while I'm scratching my head giggling.",
      "If it did not take talent that a normal person does not possess, a stroke of creativity that is less than profound, or an amount of effort that does not bewilder, then it is not art.

      "Plus it’s a good way to hide(P2P) monetary transactions, for say, black market or illegal activities or anything in its exchange.

So this entire post is mostly BS.\n\nThe real scam is when the wealthy set up a fake charity and put their kids on the board.

      "Remember when everyone forgot what insider trading is? Look I'm not trying to say what these people did was right,*however* it was **not** insider trading.\n\nFor those of you, and there appears to be many of you, who dont know what insider trading is. In broad strokes. It is when you are privy to information **NOT** widely available to the public and trade based on that information. An example being. You learn from a friend who works at a major company that this major company is about to announce a merger with another major company that will undoubtedly raise share costs. Then you act on it by buying or selling shares.\n\nWhy is this not a case of this? Because simply put it was public information that there was a highly infectious disease spreading across the Asian world. Literally everyone knew this. These folks simply read the market, and where right. Now mind you while privately selling shares they where publicly saying everything was going to be fine. Isn't that more typical American politics though?\n\nHere are some questions to ask yourself about a situation in the future to narrow down if something is insider trading. Could anyone have acted this way? In this case yes. If you had stock you could have sold it off in fear of the virus hitting America. And could it have failed? Again in this case yes. It was possible I'll be it unlikely that the virus never made it to the US and or the market was not effected in a major way by it. \n\nThe only thing these people are guilty of is saying to the public that everything was fine while selling shares. The only way this could be insider trading on any level is if you can **PROVE** these people had access to information about the virus **AND** it's effects on the market before that information was made available to the public. \n\nIn closing, what they did was morally shit. It was a fucked up thing to do. However you and everyone else could have done the same thing. Its call wallstreet, this shit happens every day. \"Oh yeah Frank I think buying shares in that company is a great idea\" later that day \"Frank is an idiot, that idea is never going to pan out. I'm not buying any shares in that company\". Or in this situation. \"Don't worry about virus. Everything will be fine. Keep calm and carry on\" later that day. \"I don't believe that shit at all. I'm selling all my shares. I would rather be safe then sorry.\" I mean what do you suggest instead of this? They have gone on TV and said \"HOLY SHIT WE ARE ALL DOOMED THE MARKET IS DOOMED SELL ALL YOUR SHIT!\" They did what literally every politician has done since the literal beginning of politics.",

      "“The NGOs — from the **Club of Rome** to the Friends of the Earth, the World Wildlife Fund, Aspen Institute, and Worldwatch Institute — all began a concerted international campaign, especially among university students, to attack industrial society as evil and population growth as a cancer, and to demand a shift to renewable energy sources such as solar and wind as the “solution” to the end of the era of oil. **By maintaining control of the grassroots environmental movement’s agenda, the NGOs could maintain control of the outcome,** making sure it didn’t threaten fundamental oil interests. **The motive of the Rockefellers’ new concern for the planet’s ecology was that only they — and not the general population - would define what was meant by ‘ecology’ and identify who was to blame for problems linked to it.**\n\nAs part of their “Silent Weapons for Quiet Wars” agenda of global social engineering, they began propagandizing the scientifically-unsubstantiated notion that carbon emissions such as from oil-fuelled cars or coal power plants — manmade emissions of C02 — were creating a new threat to the future of the planet—’Global Warming.’ It was the same Malthusian austerity agenda of the wealthy circles around the Rockefeller circles and the circles of the 1001 A Nature Trust, dressed up in new guise. \n\n**While pollution remained a genuine problem, the idea that it was ‘warming’ the climate was a fabrication.**\n\nThe cofounder of the **Club of Rome** and founding member of 1001 A Nature Trust, **Dr Alexander King admitted the essential fraud some years later in his book, The First Global Revolution. He stated: In searching for a new enemy to unite us, we came up with the idea that pollution, the threat of global warming, water shortages, famine and the like would fit the bill**... All these dangers are caused by human intervention and it is only through changed attitudes and behaviour that they can be overcome. **The real enemy, then, is humanity itself.”**\n\n“The question one had to ask was, why would the leading figures in the world of AngloAmerican oil and the banking establishment create and finance a movement ostensibly aimed at reducing industrial growth and ultimately lowering consumption of petroleum? \n\nThe answer was not so obvious. As then Secretary of State **Henry Kissinger purportedly said** at the time of the launch of the global ecology NGOs during the mid-1970s, **“If you control the oil you can control entire nations or groups of nations.”** ^24  It is also worth noting that by hammering away the message of “humanity” as “the real enemy,” the corporate world, **by sleight of hand, \neffectively diverted attention away from itself and onto ordinary people.**\n\nFor David Rockefeller’s circles, oil had become far more than a source of personal or even corporate riches. It had become the effective throttle or controller of the entire world economy. If certain powerful interests were able to control that throttle — either turning on the fuel or shutting it down — they essentially would be able to control the fate of nations and of world geopolitics. That was the Rockefeller agenda in the 1970s. How it unfolded in the ensuing decades would define wars and world economic crises in ways few could even \ndimly perceive. Crises and perceptions were being deliberately manipulated by a \npowerful few, using oil or lack of it as the throttle of their world power.”\n\n[Myths, Lies and Oil Wars](https://archive.org/details/F.WilliamEngdahlMythsLiesAndOilWars2012/mode/1up)\nF.

      "Not sure if the McCains were on the flight logs but Cindy McCain said:\n\n\"Epstein was hiding in plain sight,\" said Cindy McCain. \"We all knew about him. We all knew what he was doing, but we had no one that was — no legal aspect that would go after him. They were afraid of him. For whatever reason, they were afraid of him.\"\n\nhttps://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/cindy-mccain-admits-we-all-knew-about-epstein",
      "Not for nothing, but if their names are on the flight logs they are most definitely a part of an ongoing investigation and would not be able to discuss it to the public without some kind of legal backlash.\n\nKeep that in mind.",
      "Here's the thing: (I know nothing, I am not connected to anyone - this is pure conjecture based on what I, and everyone else, knows from media reports)\n\nI think Epstein was one of those “I can get you *anything* you want” kind of guys. Drugs? Sex grannies? Little people dressed up like cherubs feeding grapes to people in leather gimp suits? I bet he did it all, and he probably kept really good records in case he ever needed a favor later on. And I'm sure a subset of that included underage girls. But I also don't think it was *all underage girls, all the time*.\n\nThere were probably crazy drug-fueled sex parties at the island that nobody really wants to talk about, but that doesn't mean they are all pedophiles. Again, **I think some of them definitely were.** But if I'm a treasured national celebrity, and I put on a gorilla costume and jerked off while watching my wife blow a guy dressed up like a coal miner, I probably don't want that coming out. I'm probably going to keep my mouth shut, even though I've done nothing illegal.\n\nI believe that's why we're seeing so much silence from people involved. Everyone has kinks that they may or may not consider shameful, but I don't think everyone's kink violates the law. I believe, in fact, that was probably a relatively small minority of Epstein's clientele, so I don't think it's especially fair to tar and feather everyone, even if they went to parties on the island. \n\nI'm sure Clinton did some dirty stuff on that island. Probably Trump, too. But they both strike me as more of the “snorting cocaine off a Colombian hooker’s ass,” or “handcuff me to a bed and spank me with a magazine that features my face on the cover” type offenses. I’m a bit less optimistic about Prince Andrew and Les Wexner, and I'm sure there are others who broke those “half your age plus seven” rule. But that doesn't mean there are hundreds of pedophiles running around. Probably just hundreds of people with things to hide.\n\nFinally, Epstein **definitely** didn’t kill himself.",

      "Jesus christ. I'm a delivery man and just yesterday, I had a German Shepard, much like this one, come charge at me from behind barking up a storm, I turn around with a thought of \"well I guess today is the day I get bit\" only to have the dog sniff me and go to the door.",
      "**PRESS STATEMENT**\n\nCONCERNING THE DISHONESTY OF THE WYCKOFF POLICE\nIN REGARDS TO THE KILLING OF OUR DOG OTTO\n\n05/01/2015\n\nWe are issuing this statement as a means of collecting the evidence we’ve assembled relating to the killing of our pet German Shepard, Otto, on 04/29/2015. We’d like to make it clear that while it is devastating to have lost our beloved pet, and this tragedy was obviously completely avoidable, an excessive use of force, and a dangerously negligent act on the behalf of the Officer - we would have found satisfaction in an apology, and for the Wyckoff Police to have told the truth surrounding the circumstances that caused this disaster. Unfortunately, the Wyckoff Police have defended the actions of the officer, assumed no responsibility, conducted no official investigation, and have consistently contradicted the reports of the two eye-witness neighbors, as well as the physical evidence at the scene. Very clearly, they are not being truthful, nor accepting liability for an extreme act of negligence. \n\n**WHAT THE POLICE SAY**\n\nThough the Wyckoff Police Department has not yet released the official police report, we spoke to the police chief on the afternoon of 05/01/2015, and asked if he was sticking to the details that he made public through the media. He confidently confirmed that the details of the police report would be consistent with the statements he made to the media on 04/30/2015. \n\nWe are told that while dispatch issued a call to 621 Lawlins Rd., the officer verbally confirmed the incorrect address, stating “622” over the radio. He was not corrected. The police maintain that the officer then proceeded down the driveway to the front door of 622 Lawlins Rd., the Vukobratovic residence. He then supposedly knocked loudly, multiple times - finding no one home, he entered the back yard through the unlocked gate, and proceeded into the yard, around the landscaping, to a the patio area where he discovered an open window. According to the police, the officer considered the window a possible point of entry for what he believed to be a burglary in progress, and drew his weapon. It was at this time that Otto, “lunged” at the officer through the open window, attacking his boot. The officer maintains that the dog “had him” by the boot, and considered his life to be in danger, which was reason for him to fire four rounds at the dog - two of which missed, the other two hit Otto in his back and side.\n\nAfter the incident, Animal Control arrived to take Otto to the hospital. No investigation was made on the actual crime scene. The officers who arrived on the scene scoured the yard looking for the casings and bullets from the missed shots. No report was made regarding these ballistics, nor were any photographs taken of the scene. The Wyckoff Police department maintains that the use of force was completely justified, as the dog was violently attacking the Officer, putting his life at risk. Despite this, the officer sustained no injuries. The officer remains in active duty.\n\n**WHAT WITNESSES SAY**\n\nTwo adult residents and a child were home mid-afternoon on 04/29/2015. Having just had their windows professionally cleaned, the blinds in their home were open on every window. One of the residents was inspecting the work done on the windows and noticed some unusual damage to one of them, indicating a potential point of entry for what could be a future burglary incident. He called his cleaning service, and they denied causing the damage. Not wanting to create an emergency situation, especially with a child in the home, the resident drove to the Wyckoff Police Department to file an official report regarding the damage. He spoke to an officer at the front desk, and was told a patrolman would be dispatched to his home within the hour.\n\nA short time later, a patrol car pulled onto the street in front of 622 Lawlins Rd., and both residents of 621 Lawlins Rd. approached the front of the house - one at the window, one at the door. They observed the officer exit the vehicle and proceed down the driveway of 622 Lawlins Rd. There were no cars parked in the driveway of 622 Lawlins Rd., so the residents of 621 had an unobscured vantage point. Moments later, the officer was observed entering the backyard through the gate. Within seconds, one resident observed Otto coming around the corner of the house, barking at the officer. The officer was then observed taking a “standard shooting position” and firing multiple times at the dog. The resident observed dirt being kicked into the air from at least one of the shots being fired into the ground. Upon hearing gunshots, one resident left the house, yelling at the officer for being at the wrong address, questioning what he was doing. He raised his hands to his head as a gesture of disbelief regarding his own actions.\n\n**EVIDENCE**\n\nThe officer claims he entered the property, came around the side of the house, and observed an open window that he believed was a possible point of entry in relation to this “burglary” call. While inspecting the window, Otto lunged from the window, startling the officer, at which point he fired four times at the dog. This is easily disproven. The eyewitness statements are extremely clear about being able to observe the officer firing at the dog near the gate, nowhere near any open window he could have been alerted to. \n\nOn Thursday, 04/30/2015 Zana Vukobratovic discovered a bullet casing laying in plain sight on the grass near the gate to their backyard. Officers were called to investigate the casing, but made no photograph of its location, handled it without gloves, and did not thoroughly document the scene. \n\nOn Friday, 05/01/2015, while walking in the yard, Igor and Chris (his friend), discovered a bullet embedded in the dirt, approximately 18 feet from the entrance to the backyard. The location of this bullet is supported by the statement of the resident at 621 Lawlins Rd. that saw dirt kicked into the air from one of the shots. Realizing that there could very easily be additional evidence still at the scene, Igor and Chris combed the area, and discovered a bullet casing resting in the leaves, mere inches from the casing recovered on Thursday 04/30/2015.\n\nThe photo below demonstrates the likely position of the officer at the time of the shooting based on the location of these three pieces of ballistics:\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/iYVJOl9.jpg\n\nAs you can see from the below photograph, while standing in this position, the officer would have not had a view of the rear patio area where the open window was supposedly observed:\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/xre81Zv.jpg\n\nHere you can see how close the bullet in the dirt was found in relation to the entrance to the backyard. The officer very obviously opened fire within the first few feet of the backyard:\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/BKgHuB5.jpg\n\nBelow is the undisturbed bullet casing No. 2 that was found on Friday morning, 05/01/2015:\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/blcnBxa.jpg\n\n**MOVING FORWARD**\n\nAt the time of issuing this statement, we have not alerted the Wyckoff Police Department to the discovery of Casing No. 2, or the stray bullet. Quite frankly, we are concerned with their integrity, being that police chief does not seem interested in an official investigation. We have sought legal counsel in regards to charges that may be brought against the Wyckoff Police Department, and have determined that we will be pursuing them for damages, which in accordance to New Jersey law, is limited to the cost of Otto himself, and expenses related to this tragedy. Despite their extreme negligence, excessive use of force, discharging of a firearm in a residential neighborhood, and fabricated police report, the officer will only be held accountable by the department itself. If there is enough support from the community, we may be able to drive the point home that we do not tolerate this kind of irresponsibility on our local police force - nor do we tolerate the fabrication of details in order to protect a wildly negligent officer responsible for needlessly murdering a family pet in its own backyard. It is up to us to hold them accountable.\n\n--------\n\n**Support:**\n\n- Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/Justiceforotto\n\n- [Petition (has some typos, Igor didn't make this)](https://www.change.org/p/wyckoff-nj-police-department-fire-officer-kyle-ferreria-for-the-murder-of-otto-the-dog?recruiter=11862285&utm_source=share_petition&utm_medium=facebook&utm_campaign=autopublish&utm_term=mob-xs-share_petition-reason_msg&fb_ref=Default)\n",

Politicians are there to make money from the corporations whom they serve, they do not serve us, and they havent for a long time.  If you research the history of America, the power of government has only grown, never has it gotten smaller or reduced it's own power since Lincoln.  This is because politicians are put in power by money they don't have to run campaigns of lies.  Once in office they do whatever the companies want them to do.  In the case of the arms industry, they want war.  We are going to bomb ISIS over and over again, the makers of jets and bombs will benefit from that strategy.  We pay to arm the kurds, the rebels, or whoever.  Who benefits there?  The arms industry again.  ISIS is fighting with American arms paid for by the tax payers to arm rebels who either became ISIS themselves or lost battles to ISIS giving up these arms.  \n\nWe now bomb the American armed ISIS with American bombs all made by American arms manufacturers.  This is one of the few businesses that still manufacturers  in American, and they can afford to do that only because they are subsidized by the government.  So it is only natural that the Arms industry would support a candidate that will likely continue only bombing ISIS and arming rebel forces that will get no where against ISIS creating a virtual stalemate for years and years to come.",

I once had a hospital charge my insurance over $200,000 for all these tests and shit, when in reality no doctor ever saw me and literally zero tests were done. A nurse gave me two shots of morphine and sent me home. Some hospitals are giant scams.",
      "We are doing the same thing right now. We wrote letters to the executives at our hospital after receiving bills for about $6,000 for two emergency room visits for my wife on consecutive days. She was suffering from depression and mental health issues. They took her blood pressure, asked her if she wanted to hurt herself and then released her in less than 10 minutes both times. No treatment. No medication. No diagnosis. Nothing but vitals taken and that question asked, and they sent us bills totaling $6k. We got a third bill last week for something that now brings the total to nearly $7,000, minus a roughly 50% insurance adjustment. They're \"investigating\" and told us they'd follow up.",

      "In Holland you pay around €120 each month for obligatory healthcare.\nThat means I pay €1440 each year. With a deductible of €375.\n\nDoctors are free.\n\nSo worst case scenario is that I pay €1815 a year. For all diseases, hospitalization or medication. I can always pay in parts if necessary too.\n\nThis provides security. Because illnesses never knock at the door like: Am I welcome?",
      "After all those years one question never leaves my mind: \"Why there is no universal healthcare (like there is in Canada, Brazil, and many other places) in the USA?\" \nI mean, you pay taxes and for what? To the government give your money to companies that will steal you in every way possible?",
      "Before I get called an insurance shill, let me say upfront that the US healthcare system is absolutely fucked and needs to be overhauled. That said, saying that the bill was reduced solely because she asked for a receipt is 100% /r/thathappened material. I'm a healthcare consultant and my wife (who I always bounce these posts off of) works in healthcare revenue cycle, so I'd like to think that together we have a decent understanding of how these things work. I've written about it in detail in my comment history, like on this [well-intentioned but ultimately bullshit life pro tip.](https://old.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/idekil/lpt_if_you_find_yourself_in_the_er_us_you_can/g2970i4/)\n\nBest guess for this situation? She got hit with the bill from the provider before her insurance had a chance to process the explanation of benefits. She probably asked for a receipt and received the itemized EOB showing her copay amount, but the action of asking for a receipt didn't do anything because she would have received that anyway once the claim was processed. Or if she didn't have insurance, she may have asked for an uninsured discount/payment plan and conveniently left that out of her tweet.\n\nI feel obligated to call out BS like this when I see it is because it sets unrealistic expectations for folks dealing with large medical bills, which may be the biggest financial crunch of their life. Asking for an itemized bill may give you an avenue to dispute some charges, but just the act of asking for it will never change what you were going to owe.",

      "\n\nSs  : Yes it is a scam, especially from the perspective of a healthcare provider in a non-acute care setting. Pretty much the only thing health insurance allows you to do in the United States is to have the privledge of negotiating with the insurance company when they deny you the services that your doctor has ordered.\nFrom the perspective of the insurer it is not a scam but merely a game with large stakes: namely the ability to determine not only the kind of medical treatment a patient receives, but also the timing of this treatment, and its cost. In short, those who benefit from the “scam” will not admit that it is a scam because it benefits them.\nThe only use of health insurance is the ability to negotiate with an insurer. The only time it's cost effective is in catastrophic emergencies. These are the life altering things people don't expect to happen and therefore do not plan for.\nWhen people expect their health insurance to actually cover the costs of their routine healthcare, they are often surprised that their insurance does not want to pay. They don't want to provide the specific medication, pay for the tests or procedures, and cover the cost of the doctors fees. We have been lead to believe that health insurance is intended to cover these routine expenses. The truth is that you are being ripped off by not only the insurers, but the drug companies, and medical providers, all who need to charge higher and higher prices for things that really haven't gone up at all in price. They have been artificially inflated by the bloated and absolutely monstrous system of regulations and mountains upon mountains of redundant and useless paperwork that serves no medical purpose other than to drive up costs and allow another middleman to skim profit from denying people the medical care they think and their medical providers think they need.",
      "I remember years and years ago. Went with a family member to the doctor. She got checked out and they tried to charged her for a stool sample (it was called something else on the list) that they never asked her for.\n\nI mean, not as extreme, but still a good lesson that you should always see a list/receipt for what you're being charged for.",

      "this isn't even theory. it's a straight up conspiracy.  Essentially, insurance IS a conspiracy.  It's a group of people coming together and organizing a system where they control what (in this case) hosptials should charge for different services, so that the insurance companies can leech a margin off of consumers.  It should honestly be a white collar crime, but it's simple capitalism.  \n\nI had a basic hernia repair surgery a few years ago, simple as it gets, they went in and patched a hole in my junk with a mesh screen.  The total bill before insurance discounts and my deductible was $20,000.  I was in the hospital for 5 hours total, outpatient surgery.  I was out for maybe 1 hour while the surgery was being performed.  The HOSPITAL ROOM cost $10k alone.   Then everythign else that added up was the doctor's fees, meds used, anesthesia, all that stuff, maybe even nurses fees etc I don't remember it all.  But the room for the hospital was 10K for my 5 hour visit.  \"Good thing I had insurance or I'd be broke\", yeah fucking right.  If I made up my own fees for each service they'd all still be profitable.  the whole thing is a scam.  And not only that, insurance consistently lobby's for the \"right to increase your fees\" so once in a while you get a notice saying your fees are \"allowed to go up\".  Like fuck off with that shit, like you don't want to increase your fees.  They also want to cover less and less, hence high deductible HSA's being the new fad for the last 10 years.  It's basically \"save your own money because we don't want to pay out anymore\", which I'm actually OK with.  If i could just have the HSA sans insurance I think I'd be much better off negotiating my own rates.",

Turns out the first doctor he went to was purposely botching surgeries to make sure every single patient he saw had to come back for another visit. Sadly he was so weak after the surgery and died during another surgery he was doing to remove a tumor. \n\nIf the guy never went for surgery he would probably still be alive most people don’t realize the insane amount of people who die from proven medical malpractice",

Like they charged me for the surgery three times, and stuff like that so I showed it to them and they admitted it was a mistake and they would have it fix. I still haven’t been billed for it even though this was a few years back. My theory is that they failed to document the process from the moment I brought my cat in to when they had him released and in the medical field failure to document anything means it can’t be claimed it happen therefore can’t bill me for it.",

Both times they discharged me before any of it happened and one of the times they didn't even ensure I was physically capable of leaving. \n\nOne of the times I went to the ER I was severely dehydrated from constant vomiting for days.

      "Here’s a long but insightful history of this racket as told by NYC doctor [Emanuel M. Josephson.](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/149959457/emanuel-mann-josephson)\n\nMEDICAL EDUCATION AND THE ROCKEFELLERS \n\n“The merchants-in-medicine, organized in the A. M.A., found allies in their fellow merchants in industry at the beginning of this century. **It is peculiarly fitting that the agency that enabled them to monopolize the field of medicine and its education should be the General Education Board, an outgrowth of Doc William Rockefeller’s quack cancer cure and medicine show.**\n\n“A joint investigation into the medical schools of the country by Abraham Flexner was instituted about 1910. There ensued a publicity campaign of calumny and slander directed against medical schools in which the socially elect political bosses of medicine had no interests.”\n\n“Over half of the 165 medical schools of the country were forced to close their doors. The balance of the medical schools were left in monopolistic control of medical education.\n\n**This manoeuvre left the remaining schools under heavy debt to the Rockefeller group and their General Education Board.** By judicious subsidy, this debt has been converted to a highly profitable, **dictatorial control of the medical schools of the country by the Rockefellers** and allied financial interests, and by subsidiary social service groups.”\n\nMEDICAL EDUCATION PERVERTED TO PROPAGANDA\n\nThis control of medical education and research has brought large divIdends for the relatively minor funds invested. Among these dividends are the intangible items; allaying of public resentment and antagonism, and public good-will gained through proper publicizing of these virtuous activities; the earning of good-will through provision of comfortable berths, \nprofessorships, research positions, and others, for dependents of folks of influence or of associates; quite as important, if not more so, the power to eliminate individuals or groups of individuals, who insist upon telling the truth as they see it and thereby jeopardize the monetary interests of these powers. By alliance with religious institutions and missions abroad, they were enabled to penetrate and gain the good-will of foreign lands for the furtherance of trade, commerce and oil.\n\nSome of the dividends, however, were more tangible and far exceeded the value of the supposed philanthropies. Among these were: **the control and manipulation of the vast funds and endowments of the schools and universities; profits derived from licit and illicit enterprises, such as the milk racket, the drug monopoly and oil concessions,** which were given prestige by the support of the prostituted institutions and their professors; and a very profitable control of medical and allied businesses. \n\n**It has also enabled the group who control the Foundation and other Rockefeller agencies to plant in universities as professors, propagandists who serve their interests.** Thus the Foundation has endowed the Institute of the History of Medicine of **Johns Hopkins University** at the head of which has been placed the German propagandist of the **Bismarxian program of Socialized Medicine and Compulsory Health Insurance, Professor Henry E. Sigerist.** With Professor C. E. A. Winslow he has been one of the most active agitators for the program which is so eagerly desired by the German Dye Trust and their Rockefeller allies. \n\nFrom the subsidized group of professors there was recruited the “Committee of 430.” It is not a matter of chance that some of the professors are leaders of Communist propaganda. Thus Dr, A.E. **Blumberg of Johns Hopkins University has been cited by the Dies Committee as the secretary of the District of Columbia-Maryland branch of the Communist Party.”**\n\n“These professors have organized an intensive campaign of propaganda which follows closely the party-line of the Bismarxian or Communazi dogma. They do this with the support of Organized Social Service and with the aid of \nsubsidies from pseudo-philanthropies and of associated commercial interests.“\n\nCOMPULSORY HEALTH INSURANCE IS REGARDED BY THESE AGITATORS AS \nTHE RICHEST POSSIBLE SOURCE OF FUNDS FOR THEIR ACTIVITIES, WHICH EXPLAINS THE INTENSITY AND INSISTENCE OF THEIR DRIVE FOR ITS ADOPTION. \n\nPoverty breeds illness due to lack of medical care. \n\nMedical care is a basic need for the maintenance of health. The remedy for need is official EXTORTION or forcing the public to pay for medical care by compulsory deduction from their wages of the money that it is alleged they cannot afford to pay. \n\nThey wish us to believe that the health of the nation will benefit in spite of the lack of food, clothing and shelter which the deducted money represents, vicariously by the fattening and battening thereon of the agitators, propagandists and social service bureaucracy; and by filling with cheap medicine victims who lack the necessities of life. Their arguments are as obviously \nabsurd as their motives are specious and false. \n\nFew of the audience showed enough good sense to stop and consider that wage deductions for insurance premium payments will intensify poverty and its consequences; that the only real and complete solution of the problem of health and medical care for the needy is the solution of the problem of poverty.\n\nTHE “HEALTH INSURANCE” FRAUD \n\nThe Health Insurance and State Medicine campaigns which are now being waged in the press by social service and by government agencies is characterized by gross misrepresentation, deceit and fraud on the American public. \n\n**The public is being led to believe that the object of the proposed measures is to reduce for it the cost of medical care. The reverse is the truth.**\n\nALL THE “HEALTH INSURANCE” PLANS WHICH HAVE BEEN ADVANCED WILL COMPEL THE PUBLIC TO PAY HIGHLY FOR MEDICAL SERVICES WHICH IT NOW RECEIVES FREE OF ALL DIRECT CHARGE.\n\nWhen Mr. Jones becomes ill, today, he can go to a municipal or county hospital and may claim the medical services available free of charge. To \ndo so is his right as a resident of the community, whether he be rich or poor. \n\nIn relatively few sections of the country are such facilities entirely lacking. But with the adoption of any of the forms of State Medicine which have been proposed, Mr. Jones will no longer have this right to medical care unless he pays into the insurance fund a high percent of his wage. These contributions and levies are the essence of the “insurance.” \n\nThe estimated cost of this health insurance to Mr. Jones ranges from five to fifteen percent of his wages. The total cost of all the “health,” “security,” and “welfare” measures, adopted and contemplated , will range from fifteen to twenty percent of his wages.\n\n**If Mr. Jones' present wage is scarcely sufficient to purchase food, clothing and shelter, can one fail to realize how soon the costly “welfare” program will reduce him to misery, starvation, disease and possibly worse?**\n\nThe campaign to secure the passage of “health insurance” legislation is being waged very astutely by its advocates. They not only misrepresent their program to the public, but they also misrepresent the source of the demand for it as coming from the public. They ride human gullibility hard when they seek to create the impression that the public demands to pay for something WHICH IT NOW RECEIVES FOR NOTHING.\n\n**There is little reason to believe that these astute propagandists will not succeed in their swindle and fraud on the American public if their censorship and their corruption of the Press cannot be penetrated by the truth. With their present set-up they could even manage to make the legislators believe that the public wants to pay more taxes, that it desires to have its rent increased and that it insists on an increase of the cost of living and a drop in wages.”**\n\n[Your Life is Their Toy: Merchants in Medicine](https://archive.org/stream/YourLifeIsTheirToyJosephson/Josephson%20Emanuel%20M.%20-%20Your%20life%20is%20their%20toy#mode/2up)\nEmanuel M.

He also personally questioned the warden as to why there was no examination of previous injuries on Epstein.

His death was ruled a suicide by the Sacramento County coroner's office.

Webb didn't claim that the CIA \"hired drug traffickers to sell massive amounts of cocaine in the United States;\" rather he claimed that the Contras may have acted with the knowledge and protection of the CIA. \n\nWhile subtle, the difference is telling because it adds another layer to the story that isn't as nefarious as directly hiring a cartel. And therein lies the rub. The folks at the CIA who turned a blind eye effectively saw drug sales (and the resulting epidemic and destruction) as a cost of doing global business. It allowed them to sleep at night because, in effect, they calculated a risk and reward situation. Think about that. It might be more evil than outright crime because the CIA will always come up with a reward that justifies a risk, and one they can tout to each other as the moral good.",

That means that Nestle took the equivalent of... 545 people's worth of water. In a state with 40 million people. Even if all that water came from the most drought-stricken areas in California (which it didn't), barely anyone would have been affected by Nestle's usage.

This is clearly an example of the tint being biased toward red over green -- You can tell because his skin tone is pink and the green grass is losing it's color.\n\nCould this be done intentionally in post production to make Bernie look unhealthy?  Sure.  But why attribute to malice what is just as easily and more likely to be due to incompetence?  If an editor wanted to make him look unhealthy, there are plenty of other ways they could do it more convincingly and just as easily.\n\nSometimes people aren't evil, they're just stupid.",

When you move and don't change your white balance, everything will look red.",

This is especially true when talking about news, sports, and other live events, where the color corrections have to be done in real time.  \n\n\nWhen you couple that with the fact that this is a screen grab from a video that has been copied and pasted several times from unknown sources and unknown color spaces, of course strange color shifts can occur.",

When I heard \"This iconic landscape will forever be changed due to the collapse of theses two buildings\" it made me think WTF I'm no expert on the NYC skyline, but could do you mean those two buildings with planes hanging out of them? And then 28 mins later a controlled demolition took place. \rThe video is still Watchable on the BBC website.  This looks to be no longer true, but we all know the BBC aren't above RE Recording the news with different wording to fit the narrative( https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=JtivadbNrXk ). Most of what they showed is still easily available on youtube, but the interviews with witnesses/experts were live, so are anyone's guess, hence the question \"does anyone else remember seeing them\"\r\rEdit.sorry I cant always post workable links easily on phone.\rEdit. Ok sorry guys I got a bit wrong/misremembered, she does say WTC 7, it was scrolled writing that said twin towers.",

I don't take pleasure in finding out how utterly, disturbingly fucked up my government is. I don't enjoy being right when right means that millions of people are dead because of people that represent us around the world.\n\n>I do not consider myself to be 'awake' and I do not consider myself a member of some fraternity with a secret fucking handshake.\n\n>But no JET FUEL DON'T MELT STEEL BEAMS MMMKK!!!",

I posted this in r/lifeprotips, and someone there had $1,600.\n\nTimes are tough all over, and every little bit helps.\n\nIf you *do* have money, the funds are *yours* - there should be no charge to receive them, though it might take a while to get to you.\n\nBut don't take my word for it. I advise you to check with your state comptroller's office to verify.\n\nThe website that I linked to - again, it's a usa.gov site - also has links to assist you in checking with your particular state, or even just states you lived in before.\n\nIt's an easy process. I went to claimittexas.org, put in my name, and there it was. After that there was an ID verification, and that's all. The check is in the mail.\n\nOK, that's it. Sorry to go off-topic. Again, I wasn't aware of this, and even though I just had $56, it was a real blessing for me - so I thought I'd just share the info.\n\nIf it helps you, great.

Have some Marx on freedom of the press:\n>The free press is the ubiquitous vigilant eye of a people's soul, the embodiment of a people's faith in itself, the eloquent link that connects the individual with the state and the world, the embodied culture that transforms material struggles into intellectual struggles and idealises their crude material form. It is a people's frank confession to itself, and the redeeming power of confession is well known. It is the spiritual mirror in which a people can see itself, and self-examination is the first condition of wisdom. It is the spirit of the state, which can be delivered into every cottage, cheaper than coal gas. It is all-sided, ubiquitous, omniscient. It is the ideal world which always wells up out of the real world and flows back into it with ever greater spiritual riches and renews its soul.\n\n> The starting point of the censorship is that illness is the normal state, or that the normal state, freedom, is to be regarded as an illness. The censorship continually assures the press that it, the press, is ill; and even if the latter furnishes the best proofs of its bodily health, it has to allow itself to be treated. But the censorship is not even a learned physician who applies different internal remedies according to the illness. It is a country surgeon who knows only a single mechanical panacea for everything, the scissors. It is not even a surgeon who aims at restoring my health, it is a surgical aesthete who considers superfluous everything about my body that displeases him, and removes whatever he finds repugnant; it is a quack who drives back a rash so that it is not seen, without caring in the least whether it then affects more sensitive internal parts.\n\n>Censorship does not abolish the struggle, it makes it one-sided, it converts an open struggle into a hidden one, it converts a struggle over principles into a struggle of principle without power against power without principle. The true censorship, based on the very essence of freedom of the press, is criticism. This is the tribunal which freedom of the press gives rise to of itself. Censorship is criticism as a monopoly of the government. But does not criticism lose its rational character if it is not open but secret, if it is not theoretical but practical, if it is not above parties but itself a party, if it operates not with the sharp knife of reason but with the blunt scissors of arbitrariness, if it only exercises criticism but will not submit to it, if it disavows itself during its realisation, and, finally, if it is so uncritical as to mistake an individual person for universal wisdom, peremptory orders for rational statements, ink spots for patches of sunlight, the crooked deletions of the censor for mathematical constructions, and crude force for decisive arguments?",

      "Not much of a conspiracy but more of a reality. Its a legalized scam is what it is and like scams, it can ruin lives and it can take lives too",
      "What gets me, it’s a couple things about how the system is fucked. \n\n1- we, tax payers, give grant money to smaller pharmaceutical companies. The big companies don’t want to do research and make medicine for very specific diseases that are rare and only affect a smaller pool of the population, they want big net, many fish. So, these smaller companies know this, so they know they only way they can compete, I’d by looking for what disease is getting ignored/not being addressed directly, so that becomes their niche. But, they don’t have the money, so they get a grant from the government. This boosts their budget, they increase employment and research and voila, they’ve created a treatment. Now, here comes the bigger pharmaceutical companies, they see the need medicine and buy out the smaller company. They then in turn self the new product at an outrageous price. Talk about a winning scenario. All you got to do is wait for a smaller company to get grant money, do all the work, and just buy them. So, we as tax payers, pay to have these medicines made, just to then pay for them at a steeper price, and we don’t get the grant money back. \n\n2- There is so much money in lobbying from Pharmaceutical companies (#1 lobbying industry by far) that they were able to convince Congress to vote against themselves being able to negotiate Medicare pharmaceutical prices with those companies. A major reason these companies love America, is because every other first world country has a system in place to make sure prices don’t get out of hand. We are their cash cow. \n\n3- Along with the pharmaceutical industry, the health insurance industry (another top lobbying industry) is also a giant racket that takes advantage of us all. These companies have done an amazing job to label things like universal healthcare as “socialist” and yea, it might be, but they don’t care about that, they just want you to be afraid of it because it would lead to them losing money. The other thing that gets me is people who say “I dont want to pay for your insurance” thing is, you already do, we already do. When an uninsured person goes to the ER, they have to be treated. When they can’t pay, the hospital gets that money through the insured by up charging everything. Healthcare shouldn’t be a for profit business, at least to a point. Healthcare doesn’t fit the traditional supply and demand economic model of capitalism because the demand is always going to be high. People are willing to spend whatever it takes to be alive. You can’t put a price on your life and there’s companies know this. \n\nNeed a new heart? Well, there isn’t a discount store for that, here’s your bill. Need life saving insulin? Well, pay our prices because we convinced the government it’s illegal to go to Canada for 1/10 the price. \n\nHealthcare and medicine shouldn’t be political. We put the most into our, broken, system than any other country and we get the least out of it. All we have to do is follow the money and see whos profiting, because odds are, they’re the ones who stand to lose the most by changing the system. It’s the same thing with all the sentiment against renewable energy. Who’s profiting now and who’s going to lose out by going to renewable energy? Fossil fuel companies. \n\nNone of this shit will probably be fixed in my lifetime, I just hope more people see how much money is being spend to make us against certain things for all the wrong reasons.",

It is related to this story however.\n\nA number of years ago (at least 5 or more) there was a quadruple murder at the local motorcycle shop here. The policed botched the shit out of the investigation, including falsely accusing the wife or girlfriend of one of the victims because they messed up the DNA evidence... TWICE!\n\nWe live in a small town so this murder was huge here. Flyers were posted everywhere and everyone knew about it. As time went on it remained unsolved.\n\nFast forward to the when the incident pictured in the OP. A woman was found chained in a storage container on a fairly large property. Her boyfriend was murdered and buried there, as well as a few others. Immediately after arresting the owner, he supposedly confessed to the quadruple murder of years past, and the police bought it based on the fact that he knew information that was never made public.\n\nAn outside investigator was brought in and he has actually ruled out that this man in the killer of the 4 guys at the motorcycle shop. He was later taken off the case by our sheriff and has since spoken out publicly against our sheriff, Mr. Chuck Wright, claiming he's incompetent and feels that he is willfully ignoring his duty to find the REAL killer.\n\nFor days since the woman had been found and the culprit arrested, Chuck Wright has been all over the news repeating thanks to God that he was able to finally close this case. All of this right at *election time*. We live in the bible belt. Say \"God\" a few times on TV and everyone over the age of 40 will be running to vote for you.\n\nDo some googling. See what you come up with.\n\n**EDIT**: Forgot to add that the information they claimed was never made public, actually was made public, in a 60 Minutes interview by the falsely accused victim's wife and everyone around here watched that.\n\n**EDIT 2**: Read more here\n\nhttp://patbrownprofiling.blogspot.com/2016/11/is-todd-kohlhepp-really-superbike-killer.html?m=1",

Through the chain of command they can override decisions of local prison authorities and setup the scene for the extraction team to come in.\n2.\t⁠With appropriate government security clearance it is super easy to find a body double - just do an image search in federal police photo data base for a best photo match. Better yet, search for known criminals (free or already convicted in jail) - so no one will go looking for them after this operation is completed.\n3.\t⁠Days before his \"death\" Epstein moved his assets into a non transparent trust fund and shrouded from public view the identities of the beneficiaries, whether they be individuals, organizations or other entities. This is how he might still have access to his money under new assumed identity.\n4.\t⁠Bullet proof \"Dead man switch\" is very easy to setup and execute. It simply involves completely independent 3rd party (for instance a law firm, somewhere far away across the globe in new zeland etc.). Epstein would provide (through a representative) to this hired 3rd party all sensitive information (sealed documents, files whatever, photos) and instructions what to do in case of his death (send package to all major news outlets, law enforcement agencies etc). A 3rd party receives a fixed payment perpetually, high enough to make this really bullet proof, for example $100K / year, the only job of a third party is to safe guard the documents and to check on Epstein periodically to make sure he is alive (or there may be a 4th party involved that checks on Epstein periodically and reports to a 3rd party in case of death to trigger document release). If Epstein's death is confirmed - release of information happens right away. Simple! (especially when you have hundreds of millions $ at your disposal to pull this off).\n\nAnother reason why gov. associated entity would have to be involved is El Chapo. The reason is simple - The drug cartel could not get El Chapo out of this prison - and they really really wanted to! (they put a lot of effort and a lot of money into his previous successful prison escapes). But here - they could not do anything! Even with El Chapo's billions of dollars of narco money (14 billion est. as of 2016 vs. 1billion? of Epstein's money). In other words - from the criminal angle this prison is pretty much untouchable!"

      "The stark difference between audience and critic scores cannot be hand-waved away by saying critics are generally SJW-types. At the end of the day, critics only eat if they write reviews that accurately informs readers whether they'd like the media they're reviewing, and any critic worth their salt knows that a few edgy jokes will not turn off the general public.\n\nHere's what I'm suggesting: Chappelle burned a lot of bridges with Comedy Central when he left his show, so it makes sense that they may be willing to tear his career down. Conversely, Amy Schumer had a show on Comedy Central at the time her \"Live from the Apollo\" show aired, so CC would of course want to ensure her special wasn't reamed by critics. Paying off critics who get published on RT is simple. The critics are just nobodies who managed to get contract work for some online rag, and are more than willing to take cash to repeat whatever a major media conglomerate tells them to.\n\nComedy isn't one of those art forms where a critic may appreciate some subtle nuance that only someone who has studied the craft would understand, such as film and theater. Comedy is good if it makes you laugh, full-stop. There is therefore no good explanation for such diametrically-opposed scores in these cases, unless some underhandedness is at play.",

      " Guerilla Open Access Manifesto\n\nInformation is power. But like all power, there are those who want to keep it for themselves. The world’s entire scientific and cultural heritage, published over centuries in books and journals, is increasingly being digitized and locked up by a handful of private corporations. Want to read the papers featuring the most famous results of the sciences? You’ll need to send enormous amounts to publishers like Reed Elsevier.\nThere are those struggling to change this. The Open Access Movement has fought valiantly to ensure that scientists do not sign their copyrights away but instead ensure their work is published on the Internet, under terms that allow anyone to access it. But even under the best scenarios, their work will only apply to things published in the future. Everything up until now will have been lost.\nThat is too high a price to pay. Forcing academics to pay money to read the work of their colleagues? Scanning entire libraries but only allowing the folks at Google to read them? Providing scientific articles to those at elite universities in the First World, but not to children in the Global South? It’s outrageous and unacceptable.\n“I agree,” many say, “but what can we do? The companies hold the copyrights, they make enormous amounts of money by charging for access, and it’s perfectly legal — there’s nothing we can do to stop them.” But there is something we can, something that’s already being done: we can fight back.\nThose with access to these resources — students, librarians, scientists — you have been given a privilege. You get to feed at this banquet of knowledge while the rest of the world is locked out. But you need not — indeed, morally, you cannot — keep this privilege for yourselves. You have a duty to share it with the world. And you have: trading passwords with colleagues, filling download requests for friends.\n \nMeanwhile, those who have been locked out are not standing idly by. You have been sneaking through holes and climbing over fences, liberating the information locked up by the publishers and sharing them with your friends.\nBut all of this action goes on in the dark, hidden underground. It’s called stealing or piracy, as if sharing a wealth of knowledge were the moral equivalent of plundering a ship and murdering its crew. But sharing isn’t immoral — it’s a moral imperative. Only those blinded by greed would refuse to let a friend make a copy.\nLarge corporations, of course, are blinded by greed. The laws under which they operate require it — their shareholders would revolt at anything less. And the politicians they have bought off back them, passing laws giving them the exclusive power to decide who can make copies.\nThere is no justice in following unjust laws. It’s time to come into the light and, in the grand tradition of civil disobedience, declare our opposition to this private theft of public culture.\nWe need to take information, wherever it is stored, make our copies and share them with the world. We need to take stuff that's out of copyright and add it to the archive. We need to buy secret databases and put them on the Web. We need to download scientific journals and upload them to file sharing networks. We need to fight for Guerilla Open Access.\nWith enough of us, around the world, we’ll not just send a strong message opposing the privatization of knowledge — we’ll make it a thing of the past. \n\nWill you join us?\n\nAaron Swartz\nJuly 2008, Eremo, Italy",

Also, paying tuition was already over priced prior to virtual, but the overhead cost of buildings, power/utilities is still being paid regardless.  No chance they cutting tuition costs with having to add all this extra bandwidth and virtual meeting/monitoring tools.  College is expensive, but another thing to think about is that higher education in society has only recently been assumed a right with a lot of countries where a surprisingly small group is able to attend a solid education.

      "Art being exploited sucks but there are definitely more true and sincere artists who create with intent than there are that only create for this reason. Speaking as an artist",
      "Ignoring the bogus math and accounting in the OP, the real issue is that it has nothing to do with \"modern\" art. You can do this just as easily with any form of art that is regularly appraised highly. The core issue is that OP doesn't understand modern art, as demonstrated by the fact that the example given would be postmodern, not modern.\n\nPostmodern art can be challenging, as it is usually rooted in the biases and expectations of a specific audience, meant to challenge the audience's conceptions of what art \"should be\" or the lines within which it must constrain itself. Postmodern art fundamentally questions the value of art before it even begins, valuing the experience (both of producing the art and that the art attempts to capture) above the art itself.\n\nModern art, on the other hand, is an attempt to reduce something that would otherwise be considered art, to some essential core elements, executed in innovative ways with an emphasis on the value of the technique over the value of the subject. This doesn't mean that modern artists don't value their subjects, but that the subject isn't the focus of the value proposition that the art presents. It's about the artist and the perfection of their craft, more than what they chose as a subject.\n\nBoth types of art challenge traditional value systems with respect to art, but in different ways. Modernism challenged the idea that copying great artists and adding elaborate nuance in proscribed ways had any value to the audience. Postmodernism challenged the idea that the craft of the artist had value outside of the context of their experience of the subject and how honestly they conveyed that.\n\nThis is all my attempt to summarize, but you can read more from experts, [here](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/ask-an-expert-what-is-the-difference-between-modern-and-postmodern-art-87883230/).",

Some countries have restrictions on how much money you can send abroad. Wealthy people use this to go around that restriction.  \nThat being said, I partially agree with the claim. ~~Modern~~ art is in fact used by the rich for reasons beyond just appreciation of art.

      "Here's how it works in the Art World:\n\n\nStep 1: John Doe is an art dealer. He persuades his friends Alice and Bob to buy works by an up and coming young artist, for $2 million each, on the understanding that they will be a good investment.\n\n\n\nStep 2: Over the next few years, John Doe uses his position to hype the artist. He hires people to write about the artist in academic journals, organises exhibitions, helps the artist to 'win' prizes, etc.\n\n\n\nStep 3: John Doe puts some of the artist's works into auctions, and bids the prices up with the help of friends. As he is ultimately buying from himself, the only cost is the auctioneer's commission.\n\n\n\nStep 4: Ten years later, Alice and Bob own works that are worth, on paper at least, $10 million.\n\n\n\nStep 5: In the meantime, Alice has just pulled off the real estate deal of a lifetime, and made a huge profit. Unfortunately, she now owes the IRS $10 million.\n\n\n\nStep 6: She decides to donate the painting to her local modern art museum. The trustees are happy to state it's value at $10 million. The IRS accepts the valuation and allows Alice to write of her $10 million tax bill. She is now a noted philanthropist, and she gets a wing of the museum named after her.\n\n\n\nStep 7: Bob, on the other hand, isn't doing so well. He needs cash quick, but he can't sell his painting on the open market - because it isn't worth very much without John Doe manipulating the price.\n\n\n\nStep 8: Bob goes to his bank and asks for a loan, using the painting as collateral. However, the bank wants an independent assessment of its value, so they ask a world expert on this particular artist - John Doe. John Doe confirms that, based on previous auction prices, it's worth $10 million.\n\n\n\nStep 9: The bank agrees to lend Bob 70% of the value - $7 million.\n\n\n\nStep 10: So Alice has saved herself $10 million in taxes from an initial outlay of $2 million. And Bob has gotten himself $7 million to play with from an initial outlay of $2 million.",

      "Suicide by multiple gunshots to the head is rare, but it does happen. Here are some reports in the medical literature:\n\n* [Multiple suicidal gunshots to the head](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2589288)\n* [Three unusual cases of multiple suicidal gunshot wounds to the head](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9539387)\n* [Suicide by drowning after two gunshots to the head: a case report](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18533579)\n* [Fatal gunshot wound to the head with lack of immediate incapacitation](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24781406)\n* [The ability to act – Multiple suicidal gunshot wounds](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1752928X11001351)\n* [Double suicidal gunshots with submental and parietal gunshot sites](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8067886)\n\nThere's abundant evidence that Gary Webb planned his own suicide. Here's what his friend, former LAPD detective and investigative journalist Michael Ruppert [wrote:](http://web.archive.org/web/20050510081844/www.fromthewilderness.com/free/ww3/122004_goodbye_giant.shtml)\n\n> SUICIDE CONFIRMED\n\n> Gary's suicide was accomplished with two gunshot wounds to the head. In death Gary proved to be as determined and single-minded as he had been in life.\n\n> Because of the rampant and ill-informed speculation that has been traversing the Internet it is a sad necessity to put this issue to rest right up front. What follows should be a warning and a lesson to all activists and progressives; to all those who dare label themselves as \"journalists\" without ever once following standard journalism protocols designed to ensure fairness and minimize unnecessary harm to the innocent and those already in pain.\n\n> After arriving in this quiet suburb of Sacramento California I drove to and photographed the outside of the house in which Gary died. The new owners were still moving in and they were extremely gracious. Then I drove to a nearby Doubletree Hotel and met Gary's family. I note that not one of the so-called journalists eager to cry murder -- especially radio demagogue and sensationalist fear monger Alex Jones (See Below) -- bothered to pick up the phone, send an email or make any attempt to contact the family or any agency for their observations, wishes or facts. Not the slightest concern was shown by any of them for an already devastated family. The wounded were kicked and exploited when they were already down. For this there can be no forgiveness and no pardon.\n\n> In other words, one of the most fundamental tenets of journalism - one that Gary himself would have honored and demanded - was completely ignored by people who demonstrated that they have no class, zero judgment and not the slightest thought for anything but their own self-serving needs.\n\n> Here are the facts:\n\n> Gary Webb fired two shots from a .38 caliber revolver into his own head. The entrance wounds for both shots were at or near the right ear. However, for the first shot Webb had the gun angled downward which produced a through-and-through wound blowing out his lower left jaw. This was obviously not a fatal wound. His second shot, angled upward, successfully reached the brain, killing him instantly.\n\n> As a former LAPD police officer and detective I have seen several suicides where multiple gunshots, especially from a relatively weak handgun like a .38, using inappropriate target ammunition, required multiple shots. In most cases the second and sometimes third shots were required because the victim made \"hesitation\" movements as they pulled the trigger, moving the gun barrel away from a fatal trajectory. There are many places on the human head to which a gunshot wound is not fatal (e.g. the lower and upper jaws, the cheeks, the roof of the mouth, the nose, etc.). Only a shot to the brain usually produces death but even that is not always guaranteed. I have seen attempted suicide and homicide victims survive after a .38 \"ball\" round had passed completely through and exited the opposite side of the skull.\n\n> Based upon an initial statement I received from an unidentified Coroner's spokesperson on the day of Gary's death, I and others had suspected a shotgun had been used because of indications of multiple wounds and the fact that one statement indicated that there was substantial disfigurement. At the time, my notes indicated that the Coroner's staff member had said there was only one gunshot. That led me to suspect a shotgun. (12 Gauge shotguns using 00 buckshot release between nine and twelve pellets, each causing a separate wound.). However, in an initial email to certain activists, authors and leaders who knew Gary, I was careful to use the qualifying word \"suspect\" because we didn't know for sure what kind of a weapon had been used and I said so. Given what Gary's brother and ex wife were to tell me later it's just possible that the Coroner's staffer made a mistake. Her phones were ringing off the hook. That happens sometimes and that's why reporters double check things. The fact that Gary had used a .38 was not disclosed until a December 14th Coroner's statement and a follow-up story from the Sacramento Bee were necessitated by the hysterical rumor mongering an unbridled publishing coming from the activist-progressive community.\n\n> Both Gary's ex-wife Susan and his brother Kurt viewed the body and they confirmed the location of the wounds to me when I met them.\n\n> In addition, Gary left multiple suicide notes to family members which were confirmed to be in his own hand by them. He laid his driver's license out on the bed next to where he shot himself so that paramedics would be able to identify him. He had carefully placed his baby shoes in his mother's (her name is Anita and she is a real human being) storage bin. He had recently changed his bank account to make his ex-wife Susan the beneficiary. He had made statements to her in the days before his death that if this way the way he had to live he didn't want to continue.\n\n> There had been no reported deaths threats against Webb and no physical violence directed against him in the days preceding his death. There had been no reported burglaries of his residence and Gary had mentioned no recent difficulties or threats of any kind to his family. Several members of his family had seen Gary in the last days preceding the suicide and nothing out of the ordinary had happened except for the fact that his motorcycle had been stolen. Many friends and colleagues were aware of what writing assignments Gary had been working on for a small local magazine and none of them had to do with the CIA or drug running or major government corruption even approaching the magnitude of the Dark Alliance stories. He had no pending book contract, no publisher and - in fact - couldn't even get a full time job as a reporter. He was not writing another book.\n\n> Thanks to the LA Times, the Washington Post, the New York Times and all major print publications in the country Gary Webb had become virtually unemployable in the world of big newspapers or book publishing. Still he was never able to let go of his desire to be recognized in that milieu and those of us who knew him were fully aware of that. Because of the trashing of his reputation and the absolutely unforgivable abandonment he has received from his Mercury News editor Jerry Ceppos, any new Gary Webb exposé in a major publication would have been discredited, discounted and ignored as soon as the major media saw his byline.\n\n> Veteran journalist and American expatriate Al Giordano described Gary's dwindling hopes and despair in detail in a brilliant essay titled \"Do What Gary Webb Did\". It is a painful read but well worth the effort for those who have doubts.\n\n> A note warning movers arriving at Gary's house on Saturday morning, asking them to not enter the house but call paramedics had been taped on the front door. Gary was well-familiar with police procedures from his years as an investigative street reporter. He protected the crime scene for them. He knew that a homicide (suicide) crime scene could not be initiated until after an official pronouncement of death. Police officers cannot pronounce death. Only paramedics or doctors can do that. That was the first step and he knew it. He was careful to leave his license next to where his body was found to expedite the identification process. He was thinking of the paramedics and the cops and making their job easier. He had been scheduled to vacate his house that day because - due to his chronic inability to get a job with a large newspaper - he was unable to keep up the payments. It had been sold and he was moving out.\n\n> Ironically his stolen motorcycle was recovered by the police just a few days after his death.\n\n> These are facts that cannot be faked unless one was to assume that Gary Webb was a willing conspirator in his own murder. The fact of Gary Webb's suicide is open and shut.\n",

PART 2 - The next 300+ page breakdown. -- Well, I didn’t get much sleep and [posting this goes against the recommendation of my doctor](https://nypost.com/2019/08/15/jeffrey-epsteins-gal-pal-ghislaine-maxwell-spotted-at-in-n-out-burger-in-first-photos-since-his-death/ “Epstein Gal pal found at IN-N-OUT reading book on Deaths of CIA Operatives”), but I finished it and just in time for Friday morning.\n\nFirst, I would just like to say thank you to everyone who upvoted, shared this and gave me an award. You guys really motivated me to keep reading this stuff and broke my reddit with all the messages. Last night we reached 17th on the front page. I almost died when I saw that (not by two shots to the back of the head either just shock). So many people must have seen it and that is my biggest hope for this work. The more eyes the better. \n\nSecond, for all of you asking, no I do not intend to kill myself by shooting myself in the back of the head twice, [strangling myself in a way more common with murder then suicide](https://www.lmtonline.com/news/article/Autopsy-finds-broken-bones-in-Epstein-s-neck-14305473.php?utm_campaign=CMS%20Sharing%20Tools%20(Desktop)&utm_source=t.co&utm_medium=referral “Such breaks can occur in those who hang themselves, particularly if they are older, according to forensics experts and studies on the subject. But they are more common in victims of homicide by strangulation, the experts said”) , or any other way to be clear? I am a little exhausted, grossed out, stopped following a few people, broke my reddit, but not my neck thankfully in a mysterious fall, but other then that I am great.\n\nThird, there is one section of pages, 34-90, exhibit E through K, that you might want to skip over, if you are trying to save time. I feel this section is important because it shows the lengths Maxwell would go try to discredit Giuffre, even though in the first dump it appears the lawyers for Giuffre argued that very little of this was used in the defenses case in their motion to dismiss, and what is going on in the underlining proceedings involved in with the documents. Lawyers will probably enjoy this the most and go read those sources directly, otherwise you can skip that content if you want. Personally, I would still read it. There are some names you might want.\n\nSince many of you also keep asking, yes you can share this content. Do what ever you want with it. Copy and paste, save it, put it on your own blogs, use it for your own research, make a video out of it, make fun of it. Anything is approved. [Censorship is a issue we all have to help to overcome](https://youtu.be/wSTHgoaVtSw). The only thing I ask is if you share it please try to link back the original reddit page so people can upvote it. I don’t mind if you are looking for karma or views but the more upvotes on a single post the more we get boosted to the front page and the more eyes that will see it. If you do not want to lose it, you can bookmark it by clicking the little flag on the top right.\n\nFinally, here are a few things to look out for:\n\n-\tNames of lawyers, associates to Epstein. \n-\tClaims about Prince Andrews shady deals and friends. \n-\tWhat the newspapers wrote at the time.\n-\tHow Giuffre got the job at Mar-a-Lago.\n-\tTestimony from Fiancé at time, father and others \nOverall this dump is less salacious then the first, but I feel just as important, especially for trying to answer certain questions you guys were asking in the first post. \nLink to docs used - https://gofile.io/?c=lyoJKI\nLink to the first post - If you are new read this first  - https://www.reddit.com/r/JoeRogan/comments/cq93tu/i_am_combing_through_all_of_the_epstein_files/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x\n\nPage 2 \nExhibit A\nDaily mail article concerning Prince Andrew, Epstein and Virginia Roberts (Giuffre) \n-\tAndrew sold a property for 15 million to a Kazakh Businessman after it was left unsold at 12 million for 5 years.\n-\tHad criticized an official corruption investigation into the huge Al-Yamamah arms deal between Britain and Saudi Arabia, \n\n-\tis close to Saif Al-Islam Ghaddafi, \n\n-\tmay have had role in early release of Lockerbie bomber Abdelbaset Al Megrahi \n\n-\tKnown Epstein since at least 2000\n\n-\tFirst seen on holiday with Maxwell and Giuffre in Thailand.

So -- and I didn't lounge around Mar-a-Lago so, yes, I think it would have been a full-time job. \n\n-\tQ) And how much did you make per hour? \n\n-\tA) Approximately, I think I remember making $9 an hour.\n\n-\tQ) The bracelet and earrings you got for your birthday, some birthday, on Little -- or where was that birthday party, at Little St. James? \n\n(Missing pages)\n\nPage 141\n\n-\tQ) When do you recall ever getting a cell phone? \n\n-\tA) The first cell phone I ever got was the one that Ghislaine gave to me.\n\n-\tQ) Okay. So tell me what you recall of the first conversation that you had with Ghislaine Maxwell. \n\n-\tA) I'm sitting there reading my book about massage therapy, as I'm working in the spa. And I'm getting my GE -- well, I was in the process of getting my GED before I went to my summer job. I decided that I would like to become a massage \n\n(Missing pages)\n\nPage 142 \n\n-\tQ) When you say living with you, were you guys staying in the same room? \n\n-\tA) Yes.\n\n-\tQ) Were you engaged at that time to him? \n\n-\tA) That was a really weird relationship. He was a friend who looked after me, and he did propose to me and I did say yes.\n\nPage 144\n\n-\tQ_ Okay. Where were you sent to have sex with the owner of a large hotel chain by Ghislaine Maxwell?  MR. EDWARDS: Object to the form.  A) I believe that was one time in France.\n\n-\tQ) (BY MS. MENNINGER) Which time in France? A) I believe it was around the same time that  Naomi Campbell had a birthday party.\n\n-\tQ) Where did you have sex with the owner of a large hotel chain in France around the time of Naomi Campbell's birthday party? \n\n-\tA) In his own cabana townhouse thing. It was part of a hotel, but I wouldn't call it a hotel. Jeffrey was staying there. Ghislaine was staying there. Emmy was staying there. I was staying there. This other guy was staying there. I don't know his name. I was instructed by Ghislaine to go and give him an erotic massage\n\n-\tQ) She used the words erotic massage? \n\n-\tA) No, that's my word. The word massage is what they would use. That's their code word.\nPage 145\n\n-\tQ) Where did you go to have sex with Marvin Minsky? A) I believe it was the U.S. Virgin Islands, Jeff's -- sorry, Jeffrey Epstein's island in the U.S. Virgin Islands.\n\n-\tQ) Other than Glenn Dubin, Stephen Kaufmann, Prince Andrew, Jean Luc Brunel, Bill Richardson, another prince, the large hotel chain owner and Marvin Minsky, is there anyone else that Ghislaine Maxwell directed you to go have sex with? A) I am definitely sure there is. But can I remember everybody's name? No.\n\nExhibit O\n\nPage 154-162\n\n-\tPhoto of documents involving school documents\n\nExhibit P\n\nVIDEOTAPED DEPOSITION OF TONY FIGUEROA\n\nPage 1173\n\n-\tQ) And just to be clear, she already lived in the apartment? A) Yeah. She lived in the apartment with her ex-boyfriend Michael and JJ. And I think there was somebody else. I don't remember who, though.\n\nPage 174\n\n-\tQ) When did your relationship with Ms. Roberts end the second time? \n\n-\tA) When she went to Thailand and never heard from her again. \n\n-\tTHE COURT REPORTER: I'm sorry. Can you re-answer?  \n\n-\tA) Yeah. When Jeffry sent her to Thailand. And then I never heard from her again until freaking, like, two days ago.\n\nPage 176\n\n-\tQ) Did Ms. Roberts ever tell she had met a senator? \n\n-\tA) Not that I'm aware of. I mean, she's told me that she met a bunch of people before. And after it started becoming, like, an almost everyday thing about -- just hearing about famous people with Jeffrey and stuff like that, it's, like, I kind of didn't, like, tone it out, but I just -- it became normal, so I just stopped, like, listening to all the details, because I was not going to meet these people, you know what I mean? It's just, like, all right.  \n\n-\tQ) Was she excited that she was meeting famous people? \n\n-\tA) Yeah.\n\nExhibit Q\n\nCONFIDENTIAL VIDEO DEPOSITION OF VIRGINIA GIUFFRE\n\nPage 189 \n\n-\tRelated to employment at other places\n\nExhibit R\n\nPage 195\n\n-\tSocial security evidence between 1998–2002 and 2013-2015\n\nPage 196\n\n-\tRecord do not show the exact date of employment (month and day) because SS do not need this information to figure Social Security benefits.

Do you recall whether this was intended to be a full-time job? \n\n-\tA) I don't remember if it was full time or just summer jobs or, you know, during season. It was probably for a season because Mar-a-Lago is seasonal. I mean, I was there year round but a lot of people are seasonal, you know, because it's like snowbirds, you know, summertime comes and nobody wants to be down in south Florida. \n\n-\tQ) What would you call the season, the seasonal aspect of Mar-a-Lago? What's the season? \n\n-\tA) Probably from September or October to, you know, maybe May, I guess. \n\n-\tQ) Is that the coolest time? \n\n-\tA) Times of the year, yes. \n\n-\tQ) And it's more guests that come during that period of time? \n\n-\tA) Yes. \n\n-\tQ) And is there more staff brought on during that period of time?\n\nPage 224\n\n-\tA) Yes. \n\n-\tQ) You saw that happen every year that you were there? \n\n-\tA) Every year. \n\n-\tQ) And in the summer, it's relatively dead because it's so hot? \n\n-\tA) Basically, it closed during the summer. That's when we would kind of work on everything and then make sure everything is up to snuff for the next year, you know. \n\n-\tQ) Do you remember what capacity Virginia was hired to work in, what her job title was, for example? \n\n-\tA) I don't know. I would have lunch with Virginia. That's about as much as I know about what she did. I was busy all the time. \n\n-\tQ) I understand. \n\n-\tA) I didn't have time to go see what she was doing. I didn't really talk to Angela about what she had to do. I think that was her name, Angela. But it's kind of the name that sticks out. \n\n(Missing pages)\n\nPage 225\n\n-\tA Where did I learn that? \n\n-\tQ) Uh-huh. \n\n-\tA) I think Virginia had told me that there was a lady in the spa area named Ms. Maxwell. I don't know her. I couldn't tell you what she looked like. But just she said Ms. Maxwell said she can get me a job with Jeffrey Epstein who is a friend of Donald Trump, so I figured, well, he was a good guy or whatever, you know, and that she was going to learn massage therapy. \n\n-\tQ) When did Virginia tell you this? \n\n-\tA) Oh, I can't tell you what date and time but I don't remember.\n\n-\tQ I understand. Did she tell you this while she was working at Mar-a-Lago? \n\n-\tA) Yes. I mean, after she had been there for a little bit, you know, and then she told me, yes, that she could possibly get this other job\n\nPage 226\n\n-\tQ) Did you ever meet Jeffrey Epstein? \n\n-\tA) Once. \n\n-\tQ) When was that? \n\n-\tA) I dropped Virginia off at the house once and he came out and I met him and seemed just fine to me. I mean, you can't tell people by looking at them. I mean, I know now from, you know, what I've read that he's not a good guy. But you can't tell. You know, you don't even know your neighbors sometimes, you know.\n\n-\tQ) Was it about the same time Virginia started working with him? \n\n-\tA) Yeah. \n\n-\tQ) Was it later? \n\n-\tA) I think it was about the time she started. Because I wanted to see where she was at, you know. And it was just a mansion down the street from, you know, Mar-a-Lago. So I didn't think twice about it. I didn't think nothing of it. He came out. He was very cordial, very nice.\n\nPage 228\n\n-\tQ) Okay. Have you ever met Ms. Maxwell? \n\n-\tA) Not that I remember ever meeting her.\n\nExhibit U\n\nPage 232 \n\n-\tThe Mar-a-Lago Club, L.C.

At first, the masseuse was doing a lovely job and I was enjoying it, but it soon turned out to be the most horrendous experience for massage.  She asked me to pay beforehand - and like someone else said, this should've been a huge red flag but I was a Walk-In and they were able to do it right away (should've been another alarm), so I tried to put minor irritations aside. However, about 10 mins into the massage the doorbell kept ringing from mail men or staff going in and out. It's the Big Ben, 8-count \"Ding Dong Ding Dong, Ding Dong Ding Dong\" type so impossible to ignore. The phone rings constantly and then you can hear the manager shout back in Asian. At some point, the manager began to shout questions to my attendant through the door and this went on for about  4 mins - not kidding! Eventually the door opened for them to continue a discussion with me lying there half naked and barely covered. My attendant left the room. When 'she' came back, I realized the hands on me now weren't the same as before. These hands didn't feel like a qualified masseuse. So when THIS attendant left the room to answer the phone again, leaving the door open (!), I sat up, had to wait for them to return to tell them I wasn't going to put up with this any longer. The manager told me she'd refund my c card payment, then pretended to not know how to do it up front as I stood there, fed up. When I threatened to call my bank and have the charge contested, she suddenly remembered how. Funny how that goes.  Stay away. Someone shut this place down and let these girls go work somewhere else. I have to add that I WAS having a good massage, but obviously this place is being ran into the ground by bad management. Note: When you enter, look at the manager's face... you'll see stress in her eyes. I should've listened to my gut when I noticed that. Better still, someone should perhaps investigate this business to check these girls are being paid and not slaves. Something fishy here.. \"",

It's kind of shitty to take a cell phone pic of someone in a Walmart, just so that you can make fun of them online. That's low. That's some fucking middle school shit. But people can be unpleasant. No one is going to stop people from behaving that way. The only way they'll stop is if they look at themselves and realize that it's not right to dehumanize other people like that.\n\nLook, I've been the /r/fatpeoplehate. People there like to circlejerk about how others on Reddit complain about them. It feeds into the perverse social solidarity that ties that place together. People unite when they feel somehow oppressed. Banning /r/fatpeoplehate will only strengthen that community, not dissolve it.\n\n**But let's get real.** Naturally, \"creating a safe space,\" and protecting people from being offended, isn't the *real* reason for banning \"harassing\" subreddits. As someone already pointed out in the comments on /r/announcements, it's about **making Reddit more palatable and friendly to advertisers.** \n\nFor example, let's look at why /r/fatpeoplehate was banned, but evidently, /r/coontown is still up and running. This is my hypothesis: subs that were targeted are the ones with higher traffic. As sad as it is, /r/fatpeoplehate is popular. It makes /r/all on a fairly regular basis. It's highly visible. The nail that sticks out gets pounded down. \n\nIt's all about making Reddit look good for advertisers. Reddit has struggled to monetize in the past, and like it or not, I strongly suspect that they're headed in that direction. If a sub that gets big enough is deemed \"offensive,\" it will be eliminated. Why? Because Reddit probably doesn't care about what goes on with 100 people on some tiny little sub. But they only want \"safe\" content to make the signed-out Front Page and /r/all. They don't want Reddit novices or advertisers to pull up Reddit and see that stuff. They want some not-so-controversial news pieces and plenty of nice, vapid, palatable jokes and memes. \n\n**\"Safe space\" is right. But it's not about being \"safe\" for the individual. It's about being \"safe\" for advertisers to reach as many people as possible.**\n\nTo me, the saddest thing about this, is that it's *not* some grand conspiracy of politicians or corporations. It's not even *about* trying to stifle free speech among the populace about political ideas or controversial views. **It's about advertising. It's about selling more products to consumers. Reddit is curtailing free speech to sell more Coca-Cola, more iPads, more fast food. And that's just depressing.**",

      "The burning of Alexandria is one of those great exxagerated historical events by people with little knowledge of history.\n\nProbably next to nothing, and certainly nothing of importance was lost. Alexandria was hardly the only library in the world, and the libraries at Pergamum and later Rome herself rivaled Alexandria in scale. Antony replaced the losses of the fire during the Alexandrine War with copies made from the library at Pergamum, and libraries in gymnasia or simply founded for citizens abound during that period in the Greek world, they're in like literally every city of any size. If anything at all was lost it was almost certainly mainly critical commentaries on various authors, as well as catalogs of their works--both the Alexandrian library and the Pergamene one were famous for producing such commentaries. Pretty much everything else of value would have existed elsewhere. It's possible that a few (at that time probably little-known) philosophical texts might have been lost, but even such texts are likely to have had other copies elsewhere. For example, Aristotle's didactic texts are practically unknown in the Hellenistic Period, before a first century, B.C. edition was compiled, but they existed at the very least probably both in Alexandria and the library of the Peripatetics themselves (probably also in Pergamum). \n\nWe do not lose texts because of catastrophic events that wipe out all copies of them. We lose texts because they stop being copied. Papyrus is really freaking old and even in Egypt doesn't preserve as well as we'd like. Fragmentary papyrus finds are extremely important to Classicists, but the overwhelming majority of our texts (and pretty much all our complete ones) are known from medieval copies. The destruction of the library, whenever exactly it happened, would have had next to no impact on the transmission of texts. Imagine if we went down to the Library of Congress right now--or better yet forty years ago before the Internet--and burned all the stacks and catalogs. That would be a big deal, but would it wipe out knowledge of what was there? Besides the catalogs themselves and any supplementary material that the library had put together for its own purposes...no, not really. Those books all exist elsewhere, except for a handful of extremely rare texts and the stuff the library puts together for its own purposes. Most texts that are lost now were already lost in late antiquity or the early Middle Ages, simply because they were not copied enough. Even a brief period of unpopularity might result in a sharp decline in the survivability of an author--Catullus, despite being unanimously praised by ancient and modern critics, briefly lost popularity under the Antonines and already by late antiquity authors were lamenting the difficulty in obtaining a copy of his poems. The most likely texts to survive were the ones used in the school curricula, which is why we have so many copies of Caesar, Virgil, and Homer, or foundational philosophical texts, especially Plato and Aristotle's didactic works (his exoteric texts had already been lost by the early Middle Ages). The loss of textual material has very little to do with catastrophic events.\n\nAfter all, what would have happened if the Library had survived? The collection would be long-decayed by now--the large papyrus finds at places like Oxyrhynchus are due to a large part not to Egypt as a whole but the fact that the climate combined with the garbage heaps in which these papyri are found causes the papyri to get stuck in airless pockets and stuff. So we would know the texts by copies anyway. Alexandria was cut off from the Byzantine scholars who copied Greek (and Muslim scholars generally worked from translation), so the survival of the collection would not have influenced their work significantly. And in any case, as I keep stressing, what was in there was already known elsewhere. Even within the city of Alexandria itself several copies of those texts existed in various locations, many of them on warehouses at the harbor ready to be exported (Badian, for example, conjectured that it was one of these warehouses that Caesar's troops set fire to, since he was nowhere near the palace complex). It might be nice to have some of the commentaries on various authors that we knew certain Alexandrian scholars put together for their private use, but commentaries are like reading footnotes, we'd rather have the texts themselves--and the texts on which the commentators were commenting existed elsewhere as well.\n\n",

      "Guerilla Open Access Manifesto\n\nInformation is power. But like all power, there are those who want to keep it for themselves. The world’s entire scientific and cultural heritage, published over centuries in books and journals, is increasingly being digitized and locked up by a handful of private corporations. Want to read the papers featuring the most famous results of the sciences? You’ll need to send enormous amounts to publishers like Reed Elsevier.\n\nThere are those struggling to change this. The Open Access Movement has fought valiantly to ensure that scientists do not sign their copyrights away but instead ensure their work is published on the Internet, under terms that allow anyone to access it. But even under the best scenarios, their work will only apply to things published in the future. Everything up until now will have been lost.\n\nThat is too high a price to pay. Forcing academics to pay money to read the work of their colleagues? Scanning entire libraries but only allowing the folks at Google to read them? Providing scientific articles to those at elite universities in the First World, but not to children in the Global South? It’s outrageous and unacceptable.\n\n“I agree,” many say, “but what can we do? The companies hold the copyrights, they make enormous amounts of money by charging for access, and it’s perfectly legal — there’s nothing we can do to stop them.” But there is something we can, something that’s already being done: we can fight back.\n\nThose with access to these resources — students, librarians, scientists — you have been given a privilege. You get to feed at this banquet of knowledge while the rest of the world is locked out. But you need not — indeed, morally, you cannot — keep this privilege for yourselves. You have a duty to share it with the world. And you have: trading passwords with colleagues, filling download requests for friends.\n \nMeanwhile, those who have been locked out are not standing idly by. You have been sneaking through holes and climbing over fences, liberating the information locked up by the publishers and sharing them with your friends.\nBut all of this action goes on in the dark, hidden underground. It’s called stealing or piracy, as if sharing a wealth of knowledge were the moral equivalent of plundering a ship and murdering its crew. But sharing isn’t immoral — it’s a moral imperative. Only those blinded by greed would refuse to let a friend make a copy.\n\nLarge corporations, of course, are blinded by greed. The laws under which they operate require it — their shareholders would revolt at anything less. And the politicians they have bought off back them, passing laws giving them the exclusive power to decide who can make copies.\n\nThere is no justice in following unjust laws. It’s time to come into the light and, in the grand tradition of civil disobedience, declare our opposition to this private theft of public culture.\nWe need to take information, wherever it is stored, make our copies and share them with the world. We need to take stuff that's out of copyright and add it to the archive. We need to buy secret databases and put them on the Web. We need to download scientific journals and upload them to file sharing networks. We need to fight for Guerilla Open Access.\n\nWith enough of us, around the world, we’ll not just send a strong message opposing the privatization of knowledge — we’ll make it a thing of the past. Will you join us?\n\nAaron Swartz\nJuly 2008, Eremo, Italy",

      "I thought there was a polling component to qualify for debates?",
      "Who's the one donor?",
      "Important to know that the DNC is not just a fundraising/political arm of the presidential candidate.  They are active house/senate and several down ticket races, and yes, they are a private company.\n\nTo take it a step further, they are a private company in financial distress.  Near the end of 2019, the DNC was close collapse, needing to borrow 10 million dollars in June just to stay afloat.\n\nFor the presidential election cycle, the DNC has raised 75 million dollars, spent 75 million with 8.8 million dollars left  with ten million in debt.\n\nTheir direct competitor, the RNC,  has raised 96 million dollars in the same time period, spent 156 million dollars with 61 million sitting in the bank.  Zero debt.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhy is this important?  It's a repeat of the 2016 election.  The DNC has no choice but to nominate Bloomberg or Biden.  It's their only options.   At this point, Sanders is the golden child in fundraising, but it's fundraising for his campaign, not the DNC.  These are separate things.  He can't pull in the corporate or high end donors needed to keep the DNC from bankruptcy.\n\nSince this is /r/conspiracy let's address that part as well.  The DNC has become more and more desperate, becoming more and more extreme for the sole purpose of fund raising.\n\nIt started weeks before Trump took office with the emoluments clause.  There was talk on the left that he couldn't even take office because he owned hotels that foreign governments might use.   Then there was the whole Russia thing was just insane from the jump.  This is where Maddow, the last sane voice of the left, completely lost her shit and turned into the left wing Alex Jones.  Even when the whole Russia thing was beat to death, the narrative destroyed, it still remains to this day, a religion.  No factual basis, just faith.\n\nSince that didn't work, we move on to Kavanaugh.  Started out as a 30 year old rape allegation.  When that started to die out, it went to the extreme of Kavanugh literally coordinating high school and college rape gangs.  They moved on when the \"witnesses\" actually admitted that they made it up because the were worried about Roe vs. Wade and therefore were justified.\n\nThen of course, the ICE detention facilities (that were built under Obama) were LITERALLY the same as the Nazi concentration camps.\n\nAn example of the extremism:\n\nA mother brings her child across the border, the child horribly ill.  Immediately taken to the hospital for treatment, then transported to a specialized hospital in a desperate attempt to save his life.  Unfortunately the child died.  There were good people trying desperately to save a child, what was the headline?  \"Child dies in ICE custody\".\n\nTL;DR: The DNC has to headline Bloomberg/Biden.  They'll go broke if they stick with Sanders.  Same reason Clinton got the nod in 2016, her checkbook.\n\nEdit:  I wanted to add, this also explains the 2016 polling data where Clinton had it wrapped up until about 9pm EST election night.  High end donors don't give money to candidates that are obviously going to lose....",

Ilhan Omar, as well as mainstream experts like Professors Stephen Walt and John J. Mearsheimer, have highlighted for more than a decade. It is time to craft a foreign policy independent of undue influence by the Israel lobby, and to stop turning a blind eye to the injustices of the occupation.\n\nThe United States should:\n\n* Establish a mature, non-partisan relationship with Israel and its neighbors, including through multilateral mechanisms, to promote mutual peace, security and wellbeing.\n* End military aid to Israel.\n* Refuse to support laws aiming to stifle the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions movement that cripple freedoms of speech and association.\n* Recognize Palestinian statehood *or* call for a plural state in which Israelis and Palestinians all enjoy full and equal rights in accordance with the [Universal Declaration of Human Rights](https://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/index.html)."

In war, too, the discretionary power of the Executive is extended; its influence in dealing out offices, honors, and emoluments is multiplied; and all the means of seducing the minds, are added to those of subduing the force, of the people.

      "Repost\n\nI'd like to share a passage from Milton Mayer's 1955 book \"They Thought They Were Free\". This passage explores exactly how the German people transitioned from frustrated citizens in 1933 to full-blown Nazis in 1945. Here's the thing: changes like that don't happen overnight, it takes quite a long time. The issue is that the change is so gradual, and each time things get 'worse' it's in small enough increments that people are not compelled to take action until it's too late. I urge people to look at the similarities between this passage and what is happening in the US right now. This isn't to say that Donald Trump is the next Hitler or anything, it's simply meant to draw attention to how far a people can slip when they let each 'small issue' go unpunished. The passage:\n\n>\"...Each act, each occasion, is worse than the last, but only a little worse. You wait for the next and the next. You wait for one great shocking occasion, thinking that others, when such a shock comes, will join with you in resisting somehow. You don't want to act, or even talk, alone; you don't want to 'go out of your way to make trouble.' Why not?-Well, you are not in the habit of doing it. And it is not just fear, fear of standing alone, that restrains you; it is also genuine uncertainty. Uncertainty is a very important factor, and, instead of decreasing as time goes on, it grows. Outside, in the streets, in the general community, 'everyone' is happy. One hears no protest, and certainly sees none. You know, in France or Italy there would be slogans against the government painted on walls and fences; in Germany, outside the great cities, perhaps, there is not even this. In the university community, in your own community, you speak privately to your colleagues, some of whom certainly feel as you do; but what do they say? They say, 'It's not so bad' or 'You're seeing things' or 'You're an alarmist.'  \n>  \n>And you are an alarmist. You are saying that this must lead to this, and you can't prove it. These are the beginnings, yes; but how do you know for sure when you don't know the end, and how do you know, or even surmise, the end? On the one hand, your enemies, the law, the regime, the Party, intimidate you. On the other, your colleagues pooh-pooh you as pessimistic or even neurotic. You are left with your close friends, who are, naturally, people who have always thought as you have....  \n>  \n>But the one great shocking occasion, when tens or hundreds or thousands will join with you, never comes. That's the difficulty. If the last and worst act of the whole regime had come immediately after the first and smallest, thousands, yes, millions would have been sufficiently shocked-if, let us say, the gassing of the Jews in '43 had come immediately after the 'German Firm' stickers on the windows of non-Jewish shops in '33. But of course this isn't the way it happens. In between come all the hundreds of little steps, some of them imperceptible, each of them preparing you not to be shocked by the next. Step C is not so much worse than Step B, and, if you did not make a stand at Step B, why should you at Step C? And so on to Step D.  \n>  \n>And one day, too late, your principles, if you were ever sensible of them, all rush in upon you. The burden of self-deception has grown too heavy, and some minor incident, in my case my little boy, hardly more than a baby, saying 'Jewish swine,' collapses it all at once, and you see that everything, everything, has changed and changed completely under your nose. The world you live in-your nation, your people-is not the world you were born in at all. The forms are all there, all untouched, all reassuring, the houses, the shops, the jobs, the mealtimes, the visits, the concerts, the cinema, the holidays. But the spirit, which you never noticed because you made the lifelong mistake of identifying it with the forms, is changed. Now you live in a world of hate and fear, and the people who hate and fear do not even know it themselves; when everyone is transformed, no one is transformed. Now you live in a system which rules without responsibility even to God. The system itself could not have intended this in the beginning, but in order to sustain itself it was compelled to go all the way.\"\n\n\\-Milton Mayer, They Thought They Were Free: The Germans 1933-1945",

      "Update:  TIL mods have removed this post from their subreddit - http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/353drn/til_mods_remove_highly_upvoted_post_citing_a/\n\n\nI am going to continue reposting this until the message is heard.  Anyone feel free to repost this content anywhere you find appropriate:\n\nGovernments literally create false realities to keep people in conflict. That is so that populations remain fearful of each other and divided and do not unite to overthrow the elites. It is a part of a strategy of tension that has been employed for at least hundreds of years through governments and probably thousands of years through relgions.\n\nIt is not natural for people to hate each other like this. We are manipulated into it. The following is a passage from Howard Zinn's \"A People's History...\"\n\n>  Black and white worked together, fraternized together. The very fact that laws had to be passed after a while to forbid such relations indicates the strength of that tendency. In 1661 a law was passed in Virginia that \"in case any English servant shall run away in company of any Negroes\" he would have to give special service for extra years to the master of the runaway Negro. In 1691, Virginia provided for the banishment of any \"white man or woman being free who shall intermarry with a negro, mulatoo, or Indian man or woman bond or free.\"\n\nfrom another section:\n\n>  Bacon's Rebellion brought together groups from the lower classes. White frontiersmen started the uprising because they were angry about the way the colony was being run. Then white servants and black slaves joined the rebel­ lion. They were angry, too-mostly about the huge gap between rich and poor in Virginia.\n\n>  The greatest fear of wealthy southern planters was that black slaves and poor whites would combine in another uprising like Bacon's Rebellion. One tool to keep blacks and whites from uniting was racism. Edmund Morgan , a historian of slavery in Virginia , wrote in his American Slavery, American Freedom that racism was not a \"natural\" feeling about the differ­ences between black and white. Instead, white leaders encouraged a negative view of blacks. If poor whites felt contempt for African Americans, they were less likely to join with them in rebellion.\n\nIt's the same strategy gone global. And now that we have instant global communication, they can't just lie about it in the newspaper and trick everyone. They have to actually act it out or find patsies to act it out for them.\n\nThink about it... do you actually have reason to hate anyone? ....or have you only been taught who you should hate? Do you actually know for certain that the individuals in every \"terrorist act\" are actually who we are told they are? Would the people have actually had the motivation or resources to commit an act of terror or were they only able to do it because a government agency enabled it?\n\nThese are all legitimate questions.\n\nhttp://www.sott.net/article/125878-The-Strategy-of-Tension-NATOs-Secret-War-Against-Europe\n\n> Daniele Ganser, professor of contemporary history at Basel University (Switzerland) and chairman or the ASPO - Switzerland, published a landmark book about \"NATO's Secret Armies.\" According to him, during the last 50 years the United States have organized bombings in Western Europe that they have falsely attributed to the left and the extreme left with the purpose of discrediting them in the eyes of their voters. This strategy is still present today, inspiring fear for the Islam and justifying wars on oil.\n\nTufts Professor, Michael Glennon, even explains this in his book \"National Security and Double Government\". The TL;DR is basically that you don't have any choice or right to self-determination anymore because anything can be justified in the name of \"national security\". http://harvardnsj.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Glennon-Final.pdf\n\n>  National security policy in the United States has remained largely constant from the Bush Administration to the Obama Administration. This continuity can be explained by the “double government” theory of 19th-century scholar of the English Constitution Walter Bagehot. As applied to the United States, Bagehot’s theory suggests that U.S. national security policy is defined by the network of executive officials who manage the departments and agencies responsible for protecting U.S. national security and who, responding to structural incentives embedded in the U.S. political system, operate largely removed from public view and from constitutional constraints. The public believes that the constitutionally-established institutions control national security policy, but that view is mistaken. Judicial review is negligible; congressional oversight is dysfunctional; and presidential control is nominal.\n\nSo you saw that video off the Charlie Hebdo thing, right? Here is what I saw. I'm no expert, but I have been putting in a lot of time into reading and learning how these operations work:\n\nI saw a couple of professionals work smoothly and cleanly. They had a very well-planned out attack and made a nice escape. It certainly did not look like a couple of guys who have never seen action and suddenly self-radicalized. Even if you have trained, unless you have seen a lot of action and can control yourself, then you are going to be panicked and scattered. Those guys were smooth and in control.\n\nNot only that, but the big tip-off to me was the leaving behind of the ID cards. This always conveniently happens. Oswald's wallet, James Earl Ray's \"bundle of evidence\", and even the passports that miraculously showed up at 9/11. It's a common tactic because it works so well on the general population and spin control through their agents in the media can discredit those who point out the absurdity.\n\nNow what happened the next day?\n\nWell, a couple of guys took some hostages in a bakery or something. This is where those agents who try to find people willing to become radicals come in. If you had to make something like this happen, what do you do? You probably show them that you can get them money and weapons. You probably use your knowledge of other fake acts by other agents to show them that you are connected to the terrorists. Then you tell them, \"The signal is coming. There will be an attack today, then muslims like us everywhere across Europe will stage a coordinated attack. Your mission will be to hold hostages in this bakery!\" Then they see the attack happen and believe that it is real. These aren't ever really bright people to begin with so they never figure out they are being set up. The reality is those poor patsies would have probably never had a vector to do anything at all if these agencies had never enabled them. Do you think they got those guns by themselves?\n\nSeriously... this is how those types of things operate. You have to create an illusion like a magician. If you go and look at those JTRIG slides, that's exactly what they talk about. These guys love to compare themselves to magicians that create false realities. Examples here: https://firstlook.org/theintercept/document/2014/02/24/art-deception-training-new-generation-online-covert-operations/ and here: https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2014/02/24/jtrig-manipulation/\n\nI know it sounds like madness, but we have some really famous quotes to back it up:\n\n>  William Casey, CIA Director 1981-1987: “We’ll know our disinformation program is complete when everything the American public believes is false.”\n\n> The aide said that guys like me were \"in what we call the reality-based community,\" which he defined as people who \"believe that solutions emerge from your judicious study of discernible reality.\" ... \"That's not the way the world really works anymore,\" he continued. \"We're an empire now, and when we act, we create our own reality. And while you're studying that reality—judiciously, as you will—we'll act again, creating other new realities, which you can study too, and that's how things will sort out. We're history's actors ... and you, all of you, will be left to just study what we do.\" —Unnamed White House aide[1] The quote is now widely attributed to Karl Rove\n\nThis is what Karl Rove meant by \"we are history's actor's\". They are literally creating a reality of their own choosing (that of course serves themselves) for the masses to move them to the actions that they want them to.\n\nedit:  Made a TIL post about this today.

All of the implicated people have denied wrongdoing and it's not like the courts have hauled anyone else in. \n\nThey were arrested for trafficking underage girls. So where are the arrests of the johns? Or anyone else since this was a criminal network. Way too many people knew what was going on for so few to be held accountable. The Clintons and Gates know they can always downplay accusations as conspiracy theory nonsense because no one will even investigate them, which is pretty crazy when you consider the fact that we actually did haul him into a courtroom before over a stained dress. \n\nUnderage girls being trafficked in order to gain compromising evidence over politicians and other powerful people? Shit should be the permastory that Trump-Russia was for years, being constantly covered and dug into. (Funny that there's not an endless supply of secret govt sources giving the media juicy bits, huh?)

      "Abe Saffron from in Sydney Australia, had an illegal brothel with a two way mirror and cameras that would record local politicians and businessmen in compromising positions (similar to Epstein's set up in his NY house). This was then used to blackmail and get what he wanted for himself and his colleagues. Saffron was rich, and powerful, but still a small time hustler.     \nIn contrast, Epstein had such an extensive network of friends (customers) and contacts - world leaders, captains of industry, police, royalty and the judiciary. If his scheme was only for small time personal gain - he wasted his talents, especially when he was already filthy rich.   \nEpstein came from off the radar and immerged with the daughter of a tycoon and mossad agent to rub sholders with the parasites. Epstein got to the position he had via the design of many individuals.   \nThe resources, personnel and contacts that a foreign agency could wield in such an endeavour, would be limitless. Especially, if it cultivates the type of weapons grade evidence that Epstein collected.   \nWhat I find interesting is why he got his burn notice - did he step out of line, did he compromise the wrong person, did he get sloppy in the end, was there a regime change?",

Apparently he was ‘sent’ there to make a show of witnessing how ‘not that bad’ conditions are in the so-called ‘concentration’ camps. Not one of those pre-occupied looking motherfuckers in those pictures looks like they’re  concentrating on anything other than how the fuck am I going to get out of this cage, so I’m not sure why they’re called that. \n\nYou’ll notice that I am using the approved narrative terms for these things. Instead of saying Border Detention Facility I am saying “Concentration camp”.\n\nAs an aside, I find it interesting that Pence was ‘sent’ to the border. As if they couldn’t accomplish this with a teleconference. But I digress. \n\nAnyway, I’m reading this article and it occurs to me— I’ve never once seen anyone so much as make any suggestion as to how to go about alleviating this ‘crisis’. I’ve seen plenty of finger pointing. I’ve seen plenty of pictures of Alethandria Ocathio Corteth bawling her eyes out like a sad Japanese man. I’ve seen plenty of people blaming the DEMON-rats (hehe get it? I said DEMON not DEMOC-rats? Get it? You know what, forget it.) or the Republicans. But I haven’t seen any workable suggestions from either side. \n\nSo then it hit me. Why would the news media be presenting this story to me and not expecting something in return.  Like the go to the expense of hiring journalists to write articles, editors to edit, an IT department, and HR department, physical plant, etc. Just to inform me of something that’s happening and just so that I’m apprised of the situation, nothing more?\n\nFuck no! I’m being manipulated! That’s really what’s going on here. \n\nOnce you realize that, it’s kind of freeing in a way. You start to see it coming from both “sides”. If AOC really cared about the plight of the migrants, shouldn’t the story be about how she defied all odds to craft kick-ass statutes but still look hot or whatever they fuck they do in Congress? If Pence didn’t already fucking know what the fuck 375 Mexicans in a cage looked like, would he bother to have the reporter crew shuffled out a mere 90 seconds after entering the facility? Fuck no. He’s Vice Fucking President Fucking Pence, bitch! Dude probably has a cage of fucking Mexicans in his front yard AND his back yard. Dude knows his over-crowded cages of Mexicans, thank you very much.\n\nSo I got to thinking about what is it that I’m being manipulated to do? I guess one side is trying to get me to agree to set up society as a places that loves everything and each and every person is special so long as you aren’t one of those <looks around with exaggerated caution> why-te su-PREM-a-Cistercian’s the news is telling me about.

      "June 15th      Ghislaine Maxwell hired Wohl and his lobbyist colleague Jack Burkman to get NYDA Berman fired. The fact that she hired them is irrefutable, as the contracts have been leaked. Further these two individuals worked for Roger Stone in trying to discredit Muellar with the false rape allegations from two women. Jack Burkman is a longtime friend of Barr.\n\nJune 19th     Clayton suddenly comes up with an idea to become the SDNY DA out of the blue, even though he is the chairman of the SEC. \n\nJune 19th       Attorney General Bill Barr claimed that the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York had resigned, and announced his replacement on an interim basis by the current U.S. attorney for New Jersey—a man who served as Chris Christie’s defense attorney in the Bridgegate scandal and who seems ill-equipped to handle the Manhattan caseload. Not only that but was appointed by Jeff Sessions.\n\nThat was a lie. A few hours later, the SDNY attorney, Geoffrey Berman, issued a public statement saying that he had not resigned, had no intention of doing so, and was staying on the job. Then, Saturday, Barr sent Berman a letter telling him that Barr had asked President Donald Trump to fire Berman—and that Trump had done so. That letter, too, may have been a lie. Shortly after it was published, Trump said that he was “not involved” in the Berman firing and that it was up to Barr. In something of a bind, Barr is allowing the SDNY deputy, an experienced prosecutor, to step into Berman’s role until the Senate can confirm a permanent replacement; Trump intends to nominate Jay Clayton, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\n In Manhattan, Berman oversaw an independent investigative office that pursued investigations Trump didn’t like — into Trump’s former lawyer Michael Cohen, into Trump’s current lawyer Rudy Giuliani, into Trump’s inaugural committee, and more importantly he was the one leading the charge on Jeffery Epstien and Ghislaine Maxwell.  Prosecutors said they kept a close eye on Maxwell's whereabouts in the year since Epstein was arrested and killed himself in jail, and that they only arrested her once the indictment was \"ready.\"\n\nBerman and Strauss got Jeffery Epstien, that is a cold hard fact. Epstien died in jail, this had nothing to do with Berman or Strauss, they are not prison guards or have any say in how the prison is run. They indicted and charged both of them after long investigations, both had sealed indictments against them. Indictments which take months to put together, one only needs to read the lengthy list of charges and information found in the original indictments to realize it was something in the works for months if not years. As soon as the indictment was finished, it was executed.\n\nWhat do you think the new SDNY nominee would of done to the investigation? After all Jay Clayton has absolutely no experience being a federal prosecutor, he himself is self admitted golfing buddy of Trump. So why did they need to get the chairman of the SEC to suddenly quit his job and move to the SDNY DA position? Clayton told Trump and Barr on June 19th that he would like the SDNY job, and within the span of minutes? hours? Barr announced that Berman was stepping down.  So the most powerful office of DA in the entire USA can be changed on a whim? It was given to someone who \"requested\" the job, within minutes or hours? None of this is odd?\n\n***EDIT***\nFederal documents filed this month show a company linked to Maxwell had hired Wohl and Burkman to lobby on ‘issues relating to US DOJ, Senate Judiciary, House Judiciary,’ Ultimately stepped down after Attorney General William 'Bill' Barr announced he would be resigned, but less than two weeks later, Maxwell was charged on July 2 as being part of Epstein's sex trafficking ring and taken into custody\n\nA form filed with the US Senate by Burkman’s company, J M Burkman & Associates, on July 3 under the Lobbying Disclosure Act shows Wohl and Burkman were hired by 'Granite Realty LLC,' a frequent misspelling of Granite Reality - the company linked to Maxwell.\n\nMaxwell bought the house through Granite Reality LLC, of 155 Seaport Blvd, Boston MA, the address of Nutter McClennen & Fish, a law firm which has previously acted for her. It is the same address on the disclosure form.\n\nThe form lists Burkman and Wohl as lobbyists for 'Granite Realty,' described as a ‘real estate company’, and indicates the pair will be lobbying over ‘Issues relating to US DOJ, Senate Judiciary, House Judiciary.’\n\nNew York prosecutors say the firm is connected to Maxwell, with the LLC linked to her purchase of a New Hampshire house where she was arrested on July 2 - the day before Burkman’s lobbying disclosure was filed.\n\nNew Hampshire property records show Granite Reality paid $1,070,000 cash in December for the home, aptly named Tuckedaway.\n\nMaxwell used a fake name and the ‘carefully anonymized LLC’, set up just weeks before the purchase, to buy the house while she hid from law enforcement, prosecutors in her New York sex trafficking case said.\n\nWohl and Burkman told Spealman that Maxwell also used the secretive LLC to hire them as lobbyists around early June, the model claimed.\n\n‘Her company Granite Realty LLC hired them to first get rid of the US attorney Jeffrey Berman,’ the paralegal said, referring to the name of the company the way it was spelled on the document.\n\n‘She wanted him fired. And then I guess she assumed the charges would go away or maybe she wouldn’t be prosecuted. I think that was the goal.’\n\n\"The Attorney General said that if I did not resign from my position I would be fired. He added that getting fired from my job would not be good for my resume or future job prospects. I told him that while I did not want to get fired, I would not resign,\" Berman told the House Judiciary Committee in a closed-door interview.\n\nIt gets worse, The firing earlier this year of Jessie Liu, the former U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia. By firing Liu, Barr and his team took control of the Washington, D.C., U.S. attorney’s office. Until they did that, the office was following up on various indictments and charges that had been brought against Trump’s associates. Once they seized control, Barr’s team intervened to short-circuit that process. They interceded in the sentencing of Roger Stone, and more recently, they have made an effort to dismiss the case against Michael Flynn. In both circumstances, career prosecutors were so outraged that they withdrew from the case, and some resigned from the Department of Justice altogether.\n\nIt's pretty clear what has happened here, and the honesty of the situation is. This is the type of thing this r/conspiracy should live for.",

      "I think this is Trump's exit strategy.\n\nI know I'm going against the grain here, but if you look at it from Trump's perspective, he's got a decent chance of losing this election. He can fight a loss in the courts, claim fraud, drag it out for weeks and weeks, maybe violence breaks out here and there. Even if he pulls it off and finally gets inaugurated for a 2nd term, think of the howling from the left that he'll have to endure for FOUR MORE YEARS. The coronavirus death toll keeps mounting, the New York investigations into his taxes and finances continue, maybe the Senate will have been flipped to Democrat, he'll probably be impeached again for whatever reason the Democrats decide they can seize on.\n\nAll for what? How does he benefit? Stays ahead of his creditors for a few more years? Has a few more people stay in his hotels because he's the president? The cost-benefit doesn't make sense to him. If he had coasted into a 2nd term with Reagan-like landslide and had a victory walk on whatever policies he wanted, maybe it would be fun for him to stick around. But not now.\n\nSo I think it plays out like this:\n\n* Melania and Trump go into quarantine. News comes out that he's not doing well. Pence leads the country in prayer to rally the Evangelical base, and does so dramatically in the middle of the VP debate on Oct 7.\n* Melania comes out of it, but looking a bit haggard. She's a model, she knows how to starve herself. She can do the makeup. She can do the act. She verifies that Donald J Trump has sadly passed away. It's Oct 14th.\n* Pence jumps into the Presidential debate on October 15th. Uses it to make a clean break from Trump's approach on coronavirus. \"My friend Donald was a martyr, he fought this until the end, and he told me, 'Mike, it's too late for me. You need to help THEM now.' 'Help who, Mr. President? Melania and Barron?' 'No Mike, help AMERICA.'\"\n* Pence nominates a moderate-leaning woman as his VP. Condoleeza Rice, Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski, or Nikki Haley.\n* Melania lives the rest of her life quietly raising Barron in NYC.\n* Trump's children fade quickly from the spotlight, hoping to avoid resurrecting any of the investigations that quickly lose steam in the wake of Trump's \"death.\"\n* Trump is spirited out of the country and lives his remaining few years in relative peace and quiet under the protection of a friendly world leader, probably in Saudi Arabia or Russia. Most of the countries that don't have extradition treaties with the US are in Africa, the Middle East, former Soviet Bloc, or SE Asia. He won't go to Africa or any other tiny island in the Pacific or Caribbean since he's going to want the niceties of life. He won't want to be anywhere under the shadow of China so that rules out SE Asia. That makes Saudi Arabia and Russia the best bets, especially since he's on good terms with both leaders.\n* The investigations die, the slander dies, Republicans can make a clean break if they want and anyone who wants to can try to distance themselves from him. But he got 2 judges onto the court and kept Hillary out of the WH in 2016, and that's all the R's really needed."

Wildly unusual discrepancies in the put and call ratio — 25 to 100 times normal — were reportedly observed in stock options of the two airlines. In one case, Bloomberg’s Trade Book electronic trading system identified option volume in UAL (parent of United Airlines) on 16 August 2001 that was 36 times higher than usual.\n\n(Options are wagers that the price of a 100-share block of a particular stock will rise or fall by a certain date. “Puts” are “shorts” — bets the stock price will fall. “Calls” are bets the price will rise. Thus, one who has reason to believe a particular company is about to suffer a terrible reversal of fortune would purchase “puts” against that entity’s stock.)\n\nBut it was during the final few trading days (the market closes on weekends) that the most unusual variances in activity occurred. Bloomberg data showed that on 6 September 2001, the Thursday before that black Tuesday, put-option volume in UAL stock was nearly 100 times higher than normal: 2,000 options versus 27 on the previous day.\n\nOn 6 and 7 September 2001, the Chicago Board Options Exchange handled 4,744 put options for United Airlines’ stock, translating into 474,000 shares, compared with just 396 call options, or 39,600 shares. On a day that the put-to-call ratio would normally have been expected to be roughly 1:1 (no negative news stories about United had broken), it was instead 12:1.\n\nOn 10 September 2001, another uneventful news day, American Airlines’ option volume was 4,516 puts and 748 calls, a ratio of 6:1 on yet another day when by rights these options should have been trading even. No other airline stocks were affected; only United and American were shorted in this fashion.\n\nAccelerated investments speculating a downturn in the value of Morgan Stanley and Merrill Lynch (two New York investment firms severely damaged by the World Trade Center attack) were also observed.\n\nThe National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States (also known as the “9/11 Commission”) investigated these rumors and found that although some unusual (and initially seemingly suspicious) trading activity did occur in the days prior to September 11, it was all coincidentally innocuous and not the result of insider trading by parties with foreknowledge of the 9/11 .",

      "RIP to this good sir. \n\nWhat is baffling me the most when it comes to the faction of protesters doing sleazy shit like looting and beating store owners is not so much the looting and overall assholish behaviors of these small pockets of opportunists in an otherwise peaceful and righteous movement. Everybody knows these rats will burrow out in these times with no regard to anyone or anything accept the television at target, or the Jordan retros at villa. I just can’t wrap my head around what motivates the store owners to think it’s a noble act to stand their ground at their stores and fight these scumbags? I own a small business; albeit strictly online sales and not a traditional brick and mortar. But one of the first things a small business owner knows to purchase is insurance. Insurance against fire damage, structural damage, natural disasters, economic collapse, and of course theft or burglary. Having said that, presumably these shop owners could very well sit home safely, access the damage after, and file a claim for a much higher amount than what was really taken. This would offset the vast majority of profit loss they undoubtedly suffered after they were forced to close shop and quarantine. Especially since their own government reamed their assholes out with fake promises of stimulus funds to keep their small business afloat during this pandemic, and most of the funds were gobbled up by the huge corporations as per normal, and these small mom and pops will most likely be closing shop once they try to balance the books after they are finally allowed to open again. I own a home that is right off a major body of water and a notorious flood zone. The first thing any neighbor said to me upon moving in was to get the best flood insurance money can buy, because there is a literal 100% chance I will suffer some kind of flood damage if I’m here for at least 10 years. So that’s what I did, and if the water decides to crest and undoubtedly make its way to my property someday, I didn’t also purchase a boat to try and fight off the waters, or have a moat constructed and hold the castle. I’m going to gather my ‘go’ bag and find shelter until I can safely make it back and file a claim. Let me stress once again, I’m not condoning this looting in the least. I’m simply questioning why these owners who are senior citizens believe they have any obligation to protect material items, and fight to protect stuff that they don’t even technically own themselves. I understand their sentiments if they’re trying to maintain a business that serves people in those communities and they want it to remain an option for local residents going forward. But when certain local residents have no care for your well being, nor your philanthropy and eagerness to help these very same communities. Just what incentive is there to “hold down the fort” and die while protecting a few loafs of bread? If this is how the very same community you want to help treats you, you’re better off letting them pillage til their heart’s content, file your insurance claim and ride off into the sunset middle fingers in the air. Maybe next time when these degenerates seize a moment in history which should be a means of progressing, and walk right by the real and true peaceful protestors to throw their conveniently found brick into your building, maybe that building will be vacant because nobody wanted to be made fools of again. Not to mention a majority of these businesses are owned by people of color that also live in these same communities. And you know goddamn well if they’re watching their stores on television getting looted, there’s a real good chance they know these people and their families from all growing up together. These particular owners have no need to defend their shit right in the moment and risk dying from unruly sections of these gatherings that are portraying this mob mentality and are only out to seek havoc no matter who they leave in their wake. All they have to do is remember who the fuck was doing what, survey the damage after, collect their claim, and when the dust settles that’s when you start paying these people little visits, one by one and show them that the code works both ways. No snitchin’, just getting even with some fake thug bitches. Always trying to ruin a good thing. \n\nIn short: \n\nInsure your shit, \n Sit home and stay safe, \n File your claim, \n And say fuck you to the fake bail out government and the fake thug bitches tarnishing a noble cause, \n Ride off into the sunset debt free",

      "This all makes sense in a body double scenario:\n\n1. Find Epstein lookalike and “suicide him”\n2. Place body in jail - take Epstein alive out and out of the country (turn off cameras, remove cellmate, let guards go to make job clean - no witnesses).\n3. Let media focus on how he died vs. was it really him who died.\n\n\nif this is the case and Epstein indeed escaped there are two things that most likely have already happened:\n\n1. plastic surgery and new assumed identity for him\n2. someone from within his organization is in on this 100% and working with him on setting up new life for him on a tropical island somewhere on a non us jurisdiction territory.\n\nSome additional thoughts:\n\n1. The only group capable of pulling off the body swap / extraction in such location has to be within the government / intelligence community. Through the chain of command they can override decisions of local prison authorities and setup the scene for the extraction team to come in.\n\n2. With appropriate government security clearance it is super easy to find a body double - just do an image search in federal police photo data base for a best photo match. Better yet, search for known criminals (free or already convicted in jail) - so no one will go looking for them after this operation is completed.\n\n3. Days before his \"death\" Epstein moved his assets into a non transparent trust fund and shrouded from public view the identities of the beneficiaries, whether they be individuals, organizations or other entities. This is how he might still have access to his money under new assumed identity.\n\n4. Bullet proof \"Dead man switch\" is very easy to setup and execute. It simply involves completely independent 3rd party (for instance a law firm, somewhere far away across the globe in new zeland etc.). Epstein would provide (through a representative) to this hired 3rd party all sensitive information (sealed documents, files whatever, photos) and instructions what to do in case of his death (send package to all major news outlets, law enforcement agencies etc). A 3rd party receives a fixed payment perpetually, high enough to make this really bullet proof, for example $100K / year, the only job of a third party is to safe guard the documents and to check on Epstein periodically to make sure he is alive (or there may be a 4th party involved that checks on Epstein periodically and reports to a 3rd party in case of death to trigger document release). If Epstein's death is confirmed - release of information happens right away. Simple! (especially when you have hundreds of millions $ at your disposal to pull this off).\n\nAnother reason why gov. associated entity would have to be involved is El Chapo. \nThe reason is simple - The drug cartel could not get El Chapo out of this prison - and they really really wanted to! (they put a lot of effort and a lot of money into his previous successful prison escapes). But here - they could not do anything! Even with El Chapo's billions of dollars of narco money (14 billion est. as of 2016 vs. 1billion? of Epstein's money). In other words - from the criminal angle this prison is pretty much untouchable!\n\nBUT Epstein has something much more valuable than El Chapo's criminal underworld with his 14billion ... basically and literally a \"get out of jail\" card - very sensitive information and dirt on some very powerful people. In this scenario You have to really wonder what Epstein knows and who he knows to be able to have and use such \"get out of jail\" card!",

The attacks against the twin towers started at 8:45 a.m. and four flights are diverted from their assigned air space and no air traffic controller sounds the alarm. And no Air Force jets scramble until 10 a.m. That also smacks of a small scale Air Force rebellion, a coup against the Pentagon perhaps? Radars are jammed, transponders fail. No IFF -- friend or foe identification -- challenge. Even in Pakistan, if there is no response to IFF, jets are instantly scrambled and the aircraft is shot down with no further questions asked. This was clearly an inside job. Bush was afraid and rushed to the shelter of a nuclear bunker. He clearly feared a nuclear situation. Who could that have been? Will that also be hushed up in the investigation, like the Warren report after the Kennedy assassination?\n\nThe whole world already knows this. This is a simple restatement of what everybody already knows.\n\nEverywhere except in America, where Jewish dominated media envelops everyone in a poisoned darkness, everybody knows that Jewish kingpins pulled off 9/11 as an excuse for making war on every obstacle to their world financial hegemony, and killing as many non-Jews as possible in the process to further consolidate their domination of the whole world.\n\nThis widening war on the Islamic world, already responsible for millions of unnecessary deaths, is a direct result of the 9/11 hoax, everything based on false spin concocted by Jewish strategists not for U.S. best interests, but for the demonic master plan of the Jewish Sanhedrin, which rules the Jewish moneymen who buy the presidents and the generals, to kill or enslave the rest of the world. They control you, whether you want to admit or not. They control your bank account. And they make you support their insane war program by all this wall-to-wall patriotic spin.\n\nThe totally Jewish-controlled U.S. media have long ago suspended their journalistic capabilities in favor of blatant cheerleading about their favorite subject - Muslim terrorists. Every day they urge you to kill them. If there ever was a systemic hate crime, this is it.\n\nYet, as the infamous list of the 19 hijackers was released by the FBI two days after the infamous event, and except for two feeble-minded patsies, no other perpetrator has ever been arrested for the greatest crime in American history, what kind of conclusions are we to draw from the fact that all of the people who were in charge of America when this dark day happened, instead of being fired for incompetence, were promoted and allowed to continue their criminal activity?\n\nWhat does all this say about the American mind?\n\nIt is not functioning, thanks to the poisoned blanket of U.S. media, and a deliberately twisted educational system that has produced killer Jewish robots instead of fully invested philosophically clean humans.\n\nEvery cop in the world should be brought up on charges of willful obstruction of justice for not blowing the whistle on President George Bush, Vice President Dick Cheney, and all their Jewish handlers - in the White House, in the Congress, in the media, and most especially in the banks) for their stunningly criminal behavior in both lying about the events and implementing a totally illegal coverup of the crime scenes.\n\nBut the Jewish judges atop the U.S. legal system said it was all OK, and the media, led by the New York Times and CNN, never mentioned all those Jewish fingerprints visible in the pyroclastic dust covering the disintegrated corpses in the rubble of the Twin Towers.\n\nIn an interview only a mere weeks after 9/11, Hamid Gul - former head of Pakistani intelligence (ISI) from 1987-1989 - told Arnaud de Borchgrave, United Press International, of who he thinks was behind the attacks. Here are a few exceprts from the transcript:\n\nDe Borchgrave: So who did Black Sept. 11?\n\nGul: Mossad and its accomplices. The U.S. spends $40 billion a year on its 11 intelligence agencies. That's $400 billion in 10 years. Yet the Bush Administration says it was taken by surprise. I don't believe it. Within 10 minutes of the second twin tower being hit in the World Trade Center CNN said Osama bin Laden had done it. That was a planned piece of disinformation by the real perpetrators. It created an instant mindset and put public opinion into a trance, which prevented even intelligent people from thinking for themselves.\n\n[https://www.upi.com/UPI-interview-with-Hamid-Gul/60031280349846/](https://www.upi.com/UPI-interview-with-Hamid-Gul/60031280349846/)\n\nImmediately after the attacks Bin Laden was interviewed by Pakistani newspaper Ummat. When asked if he was involved in the attacks he stated:\n\n\"I have already said that I am not involved in the 11 September attacks in the United States. As a Muslim, I try my best to avoid telling a lie. I had no knowledge of these attacks, nor do I consider the killing of innocent women, children and other humans as an appreciable act. Islam strictly forbids causing harm to innocent women, children and other people. Such a practice is forbidden even in the course of a battle.\"\n\nHe went on to say:\n\n\"In the same way, whether it is President Bush or any other U.S. President, they cannot bring Israel to justice for its human rights abuses or to hold it accountable for such crimes. What is this? Is it not that there exists a government within the government in the United States? That secret government must be asked as to who carried out the attacks.\"\n\nHe further goes on to state:\n\n\"I have already said that we are not hostile to the United States. We are against the \\[U.S. Government\\] system, which makes other nations slaves of the United States, or forces them to mortgage their political and economic freedom. This system is totally in the control of the American Jews, whose first priority is Israel, not the United States. It is clear that the American people are themselves the slaves of the Jews and are forced to live according to the principles and laws laid down by them. So the punishment should reach Israel. In fact, it is Israel, which is giving a blood bath to innocent Muslims and the U.S. is not uttering a single word.\"\n\nYou know all this is true. You know you are living a lie every day, by accepting what the TV robots tell you is true.\n\nYet you wring your hands and kvetch that you don't know what to do, when in fact you do. You just don't have the courage to do it, because you're a robotized American dreckdroid, who goes out and kills other people for reasons simply because you have been ordered to by those who control you.

In the original Constitutional set-up, the states had vastly more power relative to the federal government. Governors sent their own \"ambassadors\" in [the senators] to make sure that their states got a fair deal.\n\nNow (since the 17th Amendment) senators spend 100% of their time in Washington (and are totally de-pegged from their states). Their constituents are no longer the people from their state, but the globalist banking cartels from whom they get their money. So they're responsive to the needs of their *real* constituents: The people who fund their campaigns and give them jobs as \"consultants\" and lobbyists after they retire.\n\nLike George Soros.\n\nPeople like John McCain wouldn't piss on the citizens of Arizona if they were on fire. He has no loyalty and no connection to them. But he'll bend over backwards for Soros.\n\nA politician [Rep.

Nor would the current (and costly) open-borders policies. And most of the wars and police actions that the US has engaged in would never have been permitted to take place. \n\n\n\n",

Read the reasons why Osama attacked US. On the top of his reasons, it is US support of Israeli oppression of Muslims. \n\nBesides money, Israeli lobby has had a negative impact on US politics and its international diplomacy just to rationalize US blind support for Israel.  That is why US still has not been able to come into terms with why it is targeted by terrorists and instead appeal to hyperboles such as they hate our freedom, or Islam is inherently violent.  This lack of understanding has caused people to think of terrorism as an existential threat which has no solution and therefore take refuge in bigotry, racism, and xenophobia.

Now, I am not advocating poverty, not dismissing it, nor belittling it, but exaggerating to 3x the number a biased source claims is ridiculous, especially when it's just a click away.\n\nIn addition, that website also states it's 15% of households. Which means it is using every single person at \"poverty\" level as a household (*what percent is 46 of 320? and what percent of household are single, hint, it's not 100%*), which is uniquely disingenuous. It also designates anyone making minimum wage as in \"poverty\".  This also means if you are a college student working a part time job, or you are supported by someone else, you still live in \"poverty\". If you are on disability, a small pension, or SS, you're in \"poverty\". \"Poverty\" doesn't look at bank accounts, only income.\n\nPoverty figures are ALWAYS inflated and ALWAYS use strict numbers and zero nuance.\n\nI run a business, I am about to sell it.

      "Hilariously, the reason for the firing given by the AG's office was that it was improper for Comey to comment on the conclusion of the Hillary investigation back in July 2016. See: https://twitter.com/KatyTurNBC/status/862062047357542400\n\nEdit: [This piece](https://www.justsecurity.org/40770/obvious-thoughts-comey-firing/) from a national security blog sums things up better than I could:\n\n> The stated reasons for Comey’s dismissal are pretextual. They are so transparently, ludicrously pretextual that we should all feel at least a little bit insulted. The putative basis for Comey’s firing is a three page memo, dated May 9, faulting his public handling of the Hillary Clinton e-mail server investigation, and a recommendation from Attorney General Jeff Sessions, also dated May 9, that Comey be dismissed on that basis. The three-page memo levels a number of fundamentally valid criticisms. It is also, as perhaps three page memos must necessarily be, pretty conclusory: It renders a verdict without much more than a gesture in the direction of an argument, and preempts a pending Inspector General investigation that would have produced a lengthy and serious account and analysis of Comey’s actions. While I’m inclined to agree with the memo’s critiques, underdeveloped as they are, they would be an extraordinarily thin basis on which to remove an FBI director, even if you thought they were the real basis. And they’re clearly not the real basis.\n\n> We are asked to believe that the decision to fire the FBI director—so abruptly he learned about it from a cable news chyron while out of D.C.—was based on a dashed off memo, and a response from the Attorney General, both issued the same day. We are asked to believe that it was motivated by Comey’s breaches of FBI protocol: First, in publicly criticizing Hillary Clinton, rather than letting Attorney General Loretta Lynch announce the decision that the former Secretary would not be indicted, and then in informing Congress that he had (fruitlessly, as it turned out) reopened the investigation into her e-mails. These are breaches both Trump and Sessions praised effusively at the time, with Sessions even declaring that Comey had an “absolute duty” to act as he did. All of them, of course, were well known long before Trump took office and chose to retain Comey.\n\n> The most charitable thing one can say about this narrative is that it is not even intended as a serious attempt to advance a genuine rationale. It is an attempt to be cute. Having been directed to concoct a reason to eliminate Comey, the Attorney General ran with a slapdash pastiche of Democrats’ complaints. Anyone who’s been on a long car trip with a sibling knows this gag: “Stop hitting yourself! Stop hitting yourself!” The only people even pretending to take this explanation seriously are those paid for the indignity.",

      "Funny how I've been following this shit since 2004 and now I'm seeing some bullshit excuses covering the the Admins asses...",
      " \n\nMossad and its American associates are the obvious culprits behind 9/11. Who benefits from the crime? The attacks against the twin towers started at 8:45 a.m. and four flights are diverted from their assigned air space and no air traffic controller sounds the alarm. And no Air Force jets scramble until 10 a.m. That also smacks of a small scale Air Force rebellion, a coup against the Pentagon perhaps? Radars are jammed, transponders fail. No IFF -- friend or foe identification -- challenge. Even in Pakistan, if there is no response to IFF, jets are instantly scrambled and the aircraft is shot down with no further questions asked. This was clearly an inside job. Bush was afraid and rushed to the shelter of a nuclear bunker. He clearly feared a nuclear situation. Who could that have been? Will that also be hushed up in the investigation, like the Warren report after the Kennedy assassination?\n\nThe whole world already knows this. This is a simple restatement of what everybody already knows.\n\nEverywhere except in America, where Jewish dominated media envelops everyone in a poisoned darkness, everybody knows that Jewish kingpins pulled off 9/11 as an excuse for making war on every obstacle to their world financial hegemony, and killing as many non-Jews as possible in the process to further consolidate their domination of the whole world.\n\nThis widening war on the Islamic world, already responsible for millions of unnecessary deaths, is a direct result of the 9/11 hoax, everything based on false spin concocted by Jewish strategists not for U.S. best interests, but for the demonic master plan of the Jewish Sanhedrin, which rules the Jewish moneymen who buy the presidents and the generals, to kill or enslave the rest of the world. They control you, whether you want to admit or not. They control your bank account. And they make you support their insane war program by all this wall-to-wall patriotic spin.\n\nThe totally Jewish-controlled U.S. media have long ago suspended their journalistic capabilities in favor of blatant cheerleading about their favorite subject - Muslim terrorists. Every day they urge you to kill them. If there ever was a systemic hate crime, this is it.\n\nYet, as the infamous list of the 19 hijackers was released by the FBI two days after the infamous event, and except for two feeble-minded patsies, no other perpetrator has ever been arrested for the greatest crime in American history, what kind of conclusions are we to draw from the fact that all of the people who were in charge of America when this dark day happened, instead of being fired for incompetence, were promoted and allowed to continue their criminal activity?\n\nWhat does all this say about the American mind?\n\nIt is not functioning, thanks to the poisoned blanket of U.S. media, and a deliberately twisted educational system that has produced killer Jewish robots instead of fully invested philosophically clean humans.\n\nEvery cop in the world should be brought up on charges of willful obstruction of justice for not blowing the whistle on President George Bush, Vice President Dick Cheney, and all their Jewish handlers - in the White House, in the Congress, in the media, and most especially in the banks) for their stunningly criminal behavior in both lying about the events and implementing a totally illegal coverup of the crime scenes.\n\nBut the Jewish judges atop the U.S. legal system said it was all OK, and the media, led by the New York Times and CNN, never mentioned all those Jewish fingerprints visible in the pyroclastic dust covering the disintegrated corpses in the rubble of the Twin Towers.\n\nIn an interview only a mere weeks after 9/11, Hamid Gul - former head of Pakistani intelligence (ISI) from 1987-1989 - told Arnaud de Borchgrave, United Press International, of who he thinks was behind the attacks. Here are a few exceprts from the transcript:\n\nDe Borchgrave: So who did Black Sept. 11?\n\nGul: Mossad and its accomplices. The U.S. spends $40 billion a year on its 11 intelligence agencies. That's $400 billion in 10 years. Yet the Bush Administration says it was taken by surprise. I don't believe it. Within 10 minutes of the second twin tower being hit in the World Trade Center CNN said Osama bin Laden had done it. That was a planned piece of disinformation by the real perpetrators. It created an instant mindset and put public opinion into a trance, which prevented even intelligent people from thinking for themselves.\n\n[https://www.upi.com/UPI-interview-with-Hamid-Gul/60031280349846/](https://www.upi.com/UPI-interview-with-Hamid-Gul/60031280349846/)\n\nImmediately after the attacks Bin Laden was interviewed by Pakistani newspaper Ummat. When asked if he was involved in the attacks he stated:\n\n\"I have already said that I am not involved in the 11 September attacks in the United States. As a Muslim, I try my best to avoid telling a lie. I had no knowledge of these attacks, nor do I consider the killing of innocent women, children and other humans as an appreciable act. Islam strictly forbids causing harm to innocent women, children and other people. Such a practice is forbidden even in the course of a battle.\"\n\nHe went on to say:\n\n\"In the same way, whether it is President Bush or any other U.S. President, they cannot bring Israel to justice for its human rights abuses or to hold it accountable for such crimes. What is this? Is it not that there exists a government within the government in the United States? That secret government must be asked as to who carried out the attacks.\"\n\nHe further goes on to state:\n\n\"I have already said that we are not hostile to the United States. We are against the \\[U.S. Government\\] system, which makes other nations slaves of the United States, or forces them to mortgage their political and economic freedom. This system is totally in the control of the American Jews, whose first priority is Israel, not the United States. It is clear that the American people are themselves the slaves of the Jews and are forced to live according to the principles and laws laid down by them. So the punishment should reach Israel. In fact, it is Israel, which is giving a blood bath to innocent Muslims and the U.S. is not uttering a single word.\"\n\nYou know all this is true. You know you are living a lie every day, by accepting what the TV robots tell you is true.\n\nYet you wring your hands and kvetch that you don't know what to do, when in fact you do. You just don't have the courage to do it, because you're a robotized American dreckdroid, who goes out and kills other people for reasons simply because you have been ordered to by those who control you. Despicable. You are despicable, because you don't have the courage to say what you clearly know, even though you are about to lose everything you ever loved because of your failure to say what you know and confront the beast.

CPS is one of the most amazing programs every created by our government. Want to know how they work? First of all they have no authority to take anyone's kids. They make recommendations and a court of law decides weather or not to terminate custody. Secondly kids only get removed from their families as a last resort, and even then there is a heroic effort to find a relative that is safe for them to live with, and allow supervised visits with their parents because even children with shitheads for parents love them and want to see them. Thirdly, CPS has caseworkers work for months, sometimes even years with unfit parents in an effort to get them the counseling, clean homes, drug rehabilitation, welfare or whatever else they need in order to get these families back together, and they do all this for free. This is a free service that our government provides to people who abuse their own children in order to keep families together, because they understand that fixing the problem is better than tearing children away from their parents. Taking a child away is a last resort, not only because of the damage it does to the children, but because NOBODY FUCKING WANTS THEM. When my wife has to take a child away she sometimes has to stay overnight at the office because finding a foster home to take them is near impossible and often times on the other side of the state. Do you know what she gets for all her efforts? Barely 30K a year, demonized in television, movies, and the media. If she fucks up by taking a kid that shouldn't have been taken, or leaving one that shouldn't have been left she will definitely lose her job, and might actually get in legal trouble. She doesn't even get fucking discounts at stores like teachers, firefighters, police, and military does. When there is a natural disaster she is mandated to stay in the area and work shelters but she isn't considered a first responder.

So the civil right act either wouldn't pass or would be much weaker than our timeline. He believed in the domino  theory like most of the politicians at the time, it is likely that he would send in troops to Vietnam. I think his unexpected assassination really shadows his problems.",
      "He seemed like a good dude and President. But JFK might have deceived the public more than any other President. I read the JFK medical files that were finally released a while back. The information released from those medical records might have changed a lot of those assassination theories.\n\nJohn F. Kennedy was probably the sickest U.S. president ever. And that's saying a lot. Almost every U S. President  hid some medical information from the public, but Kennedy had medical problems that probably would have prevented him from being elected. More than likely, he probably wouldn't have completed if first term. His medical problems also probably contributed to the successful assassination attempt. \n\nFrom the Alantic: \n\n\"JFK suffered from a disease called Autoimmune Polyendocrine Syndrome, which was not described genetically until 1981, 18 years after he was assassinated. This disease made him miserable by knocking off his thyroid and adrenal glands, and probably his parathyroid glands also. \n\nMultiple defects in his immune system had caused him to suffer a strep infection called scarlet fever in childhood, colitis (bloody diarrhea), gastritis, a duodenal ulcer (burning in the stomach), chronic urinary infections, and chronic prostatitis. While he was president, he was treated by an allergist, an endocrinologist, a gastroenterologist, an orthopedist, a urologist and several other doctors.\n\nHis doctors treated his many symptoms with an unbelievable amount of drugs, including:\n\n• lack of adrenal gland hormones, treated with excessive doses of corticosteroids that caused severe osteoporosis, which resulted in broken bones in his spine, multiple failed surgeries and chronic back pain. He was also given salt tablets to replace the salt lost from his lack of adrenal hormones.\n\n• lack of thyroid hormones (diagnosed at age 38), treated with thyroid pills. Low thyroid function causes tiredness, mood changes, forgetfulness, and constipation.\n\n• chronic, severe back pain, treated with narcotics and xylocaine injections into his back\"\n\nHis back problems were so bad and painful he was almost incapacitated and wore a corset type back brace. He was wearing the back brace when he was shot. The back brace was the reason after the second bullet hit him in the back of his neck, he went forward and then snapped back, allowing the next bullet, to fatally hit him in the back of the head. If he's not wearing the brace, he probably stays leaning forward and the assassin would not have had a clear third shot to the head.\n\n\"It appears that Richard Nixon may have tried at one point to gain access to Kennedy’s medical history. \n\nIn the fall of 1960, as he and JFK battled in what turned out to be one of the closest presidential elections ever, thieves ransacked the office of Eugene J. Cohen, a New York endocrinologist who had been treating Kennedy for Addison’s disease. \n\nWhen they failed to find Kennedy’s records, which were filed under a code name, they tried unsuccessfully to break into the office of Janet Travell, an internist and pharmacologist who had been relieving Kennedy’s back pain with injections of procaine (an agent similar to lidocaine). \n\nAlthough the thieves remain unidentified, it is reasonable to speculate that they were Nixon operatives; the failed robberies have the aura of Watergate and of the break-in at the Beverly Hills office of Daniel Ellsberg’s psychiatrist.\"\n\nIf Nixon gets his hands on those medical records, history is dramatically changed, when JFK is never elected President \n\nhttps://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2013/08/the-medical-ordeals-of-jfk/309469/",

Victims are scared to say anything because complaints against bosses are hardly ever taken seriously. Also, when someone is desperate for a paycheck they are LESS likely to report abuse. Even in the corporate sector when harassment is reported to HR 1 person gets transferred and the boss just finds someone else to target. HR is NOT the employees advocate. It is the corporate advocate. It always has been and it always will be. \n\nThis is a CULTURAL ISSUE. This is generation after generation of bosses and CEOs getting away with unconscionable behavior with no consequences. This whole “boys will be boys” and “sex addict” rational is a cult.  Imagine being a victim of sexual assault/Harassment and hearing that your abuser is “a sex addict”. Since when did abuse of power equal sex addiction? It’s sick. \n\nI repeat this is NOT just in Hollywood. This is EVERYWHERE and denying that it happens because it doesn’t happen to you means nothing to the victims. Not reporting assault or advances doesn’t mean the victim was “asking for it” or that they “are regretting a consensual relationship.”  I’m fucking tired of this shit being political.

What makes you think they are going to reveal it now?\n\n>>Prior to his death, this report continues, UN President Ashe had been indicted by the US government for the role he played in a massive bribery scheme headed by Chinese billionaire Ng Lap Seng who over the past few decades has funneled hundreds of millions of dollars into the pockets of both Hillary and Bill Clinton—and that began in the late 1990’s with the most serious scandal in American history (known as Chinagate) when the Clinton’s transferred nearly all of America’s most sensitive technology, including but not limited to nuclear missile and satellite technology, in exchange for millions of dollars in contributions to the 1996 Clinton-Gore re-election effort and the Democratic National Committee.\n\nhttps://archive.is/BBPU1\n\n#Nuclear weapons.

The Clintons hosted 404 overnight guests.\n~ During the investigation by the Department of Justice, about 120 people connected to “Chinagate” either fled the country or pleaded the Fifth Amendment to prevent testifying.\nIn case some are too young to know, this scandal was the infamous transfer of missile technology to China that would allow Americans in the satellite launching business to be replaced by cheap Chinese workers, giving the tech to China that they needed to successfully launch the multi-stage rockets necessary to get satellites in orbit.\nIt also gave China the ability to launch nuclear warheads the distance necessary to hit American cities.\n\n#All of these articles fail to point out that Ashe was a part of the Clinton Foundation.

      "As a powerlifter with 10+ years experience (also a Sanders supporter, just to be clear) I call bullshit on this entirely from a weightlifting perspective. It is extremely hard to choke yourself on a bench.\n\nWhen you are bench pressing the entirety of the weight is in one of two places, your [nipple line](http://demandware.edgesuite.net/aaxp_prd/on/demandware.static/-/Sites-Predator-Library/default/dw96b4f9c2/images/articles/Barbell_Bench_Press.png), or a tad [lower](http://www.chicagopowerlifting.com/benchpress_files/image001.jpg) for the arch. No experienced lifter. I mean absolutely NO experienced lifter would push themselves without using [safety bars](http://www.usapowerlifting.com/newsletter/32/technical/fig1.jpg), or benching in a [power rack](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_QFCI4hhy70/maxresdefault.jpg). Preferably the second. I do 100% of my benching in a rack, even for reps at <20%.\n\nWhen you are pushing yourself to the absolute limit, which is only in competition, the very fewest people you have around you are [two side spotters](https://vtechworks.lib.vt.edu/bitstream/handle/10919/63878/M_122010-dsa-benchpress.jpg), usually you have [two side, two front](http://mhpstrong.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Naumova3-300lb-bench.jpg). That doesn't matter in this case, but it shows you how serious we take it. Every lifter has failed a bench, and we know how terrifying that drop is.\n\nWhen you fail a bench, your first instinct is to throw everything into it. When that fails your second instinct is to move it as close to your hips as possible. This is assuming you can't do the [roll of shame](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEUvI8Q6JDk). Even in a full arch you can do the roll of shame. I have done the roll of shame in a full arch, and there is absolutely no way that I would ever let it roll onto my neck. That isn't something any lifter would think of doing, ever. You would think \"maybe someone would want to push it up over their head and then move their head so you don't have to roll it down your body!\" No. That isn't an option. Lifters would never put the weight near their head. I have taught a fuckton of people how to bench, both with and without the arch, and nobody has ever tried to fail above their head. Generally people don't try to put themselves more in danger of dying when they feel their life is in danger.\n\nThe only ways I have seen a bench come close to killing someone is when they [don't attach the safety bars to the stand](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1zB-Bu6V44), or that one video I can't find right now where the dude drops it on his neck from an open grip lockout. Both of these are 1 in 1000 to begin with, and in both the people involved lived.\n\nI said it before, and I'll say it again. There is NO EXPERIENCED LIFTER that would lift a weight he did not know he could push without a backup plan. The only way that this is believable is if there is significant bruising and damage to the midsection. Otherwise I don't buy it for a second.",

This sub is like a microcosm of the larger online conspiracy community as a whole which has also been subverted by what is now called the alt-right over the last 15-20 years. It happened slow and I only started to notice it about a decade ago. Used to be a conspiracy website would have articles about secret underground US shadow government facilities sharing space with articles about how crack was created by the CIA or that chick that the Reagan Administration ran a train on and then beat to death or detailed accounts of continued MK Ultra related secret projects that are ongoing, or the increase in missing person cases in national parks. But now most of the conspiracy sites have an aggressively nationalistic right-wing slant where all the articles have some underlying pro capitalist or pro white people message. Whatever side of the spectrum you're on just remember that the citizens of the US are much stronger united than fractured and that there are foreign corporate and political entities that would benefit from the destabilization of the USA as a world power. These entities have been working for decades to polarize the political landscape, increase the income inequality wealth gap to shrink the middle class while also ensuring that the public schools fail so that critical thinking becomes a nonvalued skill. They do this because an all out war on US soil would not fair well as we're armed to the teeth and would make the guerilla warfare in the Middle East and South America look like child's play. So by forcing us not to trust each other and do the bidding of the 1% we weaken ourselves for they're ultimate domination.

That is our main service center. That means if any data has been deleted or removed from the hard drive, the client can have us mail it out to Louisville.

To maintain that level, the Fed bought $30 billion in two- to ten-year Treasury notes every month.[26]\n\nIn November 2010, the Fed announced a second round of quantitative easing, buying $600 billion of Treasury securities by the end of the second quarter of 2011.[27][28] The expression \"QE2\" became a ubiquitous nickname in 2010, used to refer to this second round of quantitative easing by US central banks.[29] Retrospectively, the round of quantitative easing preceding QE2 was called \"QE1\".[30][31]\n\nA third round of quantitative easing, \"QE3\", was announced on 13 September 2012. In an 11–1 vote, the Federal Reserve decided to launch a new $40 billion per month, open-ended bond purchasing program of agency mortgage-backed securities. Additionally, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) announced that it would likely maintain the federal funds rate near zero \"at least through 2015\".[32][33] According to NASDAQ.com, this is effectively a stimulus program that allows the Federal Reserve to relieve $40 billion per month of commercial housing market debt risk.[34] Because of its open-ended nature, QE3 has earned the popular nickname of \"QE-Infinity\".[35][better source needed] On 12 December 2012, the FOMC announced an increase in the amount of open-ended purchases from $40 billion to $85 billion per month.[36]\n\nOn 19 June 2013, Ben Bernanke announced a \"tapering\" of some of the Fed's QE policies contingent upon continued positive economic data. Specifically, he said that the Fed could scale back its bond purchases from $85 billion to $65 billion a month during the upcoming September 2013 policy meeting.[37][failed verification] He also suggested that the bond-buying program could wrap up by mid-2014.[38] While Bernanke did not announce an interest rate hike, he suggested that if inflation followed a 2% target rate and unemployment decreased to 6.5%, the Fed would likely start raising rates. The stock markets dropped by approximately 4.3% over the three trading days following Bernanke's announcement, with the Dow Jones dropping 659 points between 19 and 24 June, closing at 14,660 at the end of the day on 24 June.[39] On 18 September 2013, the Fed decided to hold off on scaling back its bond-buying program,[40] and announced in December 2013 that it would begin to taper its purchases in January 2014.[41] Purchases were halted on 29 October 2014[42] after accumulating $4.5 trillion in assets.[43] \n\n\n\n\nWITHIN A SPAN OF 12 YEARS OUR COUNTRY HAS DONE SOMETHING WE HAVE NEVER DONE SINCE 1940!\n\nWE ARE PRINTING TRILLIONS AND TRILLIONS AND TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN THE SPAN OF 12 YEARS!!!! OUR USD IS GOING DOWN! GLOBAL ECONOMY IS BASED OFF USD! SINCE 2017 MANY COUNTRIES HAVE BEEN FORMING THEIR OWN CRYPTOCURRENCY THAT IS BACKED! CHINA IS WORKING ON RELEASING THEIR OWN AS WE SPEAK!

Heemeyer bought his two acres from the Resolution Trust Corp., the federal agency set up to handle the assets of failed savings and loan institutions. He bought the two acres for $42,000 but later agreed to sell it to the Docheff family, which wanted the property for a concrete batch plant, for $250,000. They agreed, but then he wanted $375,000 and at some later point wanted a deal worth approximately $1 million. All of this was well before the rezoning proposal hit town hall.\n\n>\"I just think he set things up to the point where you would have to say no.'\" said Susie Docheff in an interview with the Sky-Hi News. \"He probably set you up to say no' just so he could get mad at you.\"\n\n>Meanwhile early defenders of Heemeyer contended he made a point of not hurting anybody during his bulldozer rampage. But the sheriff's department argues that the fact nobody got hurt was more luck than intent. He fired many bullets from his semi-automatic rifle at Cody Docheff when Docheff tried to stop the assault on his concrete batch plant by using a front-end loader. Later, Heemeyer fired on two state troopers before they had fired.\n\n>As well, the sheriff notes that 11 of the 13 buildings that Heemeyer bulldozed were occupied until just moments before the destruction. At the town library, for example, a children's program was in progress when the incident began.",

Was something legal because Hitler ordered it, or did it need to conform to a certain standard of German law before obtaining legality? The Nuremberg Laws, which stripped Jews of rights, were “legal” in the German context, but there was no “Holocaust law” ever passed. In fact the Nazis did everything they could to conceal the mass killing. At the same, neither were there domestic laws explicitly outlawing genocide.  \n\nWhat made the Nuremberg Trials so controversial at the time was exactly this question. If the Holocaust was legal then the trials were applying retroactive justice and this is generally frowned upon. The Nuremberg judges solved this problem by deciding the Third Reich was as a whole a “criminal regime.” Therefore the Holocaust could be prosecuted. Interestingly, this same logic has not been applied to former Communist regimes. While often declared “criminal regimes” (by the EU and post-Soviet nations) retroactive justice has not been applied. Only actions that were explicitly illegal according to Communist laws at the time have been prosecuted (as far as I am aware). All in all, this becomes a question of what makes law, law? ",

      "From the article:\n\n ‘Hands in the air! Step away from the Easter eggs!” The Keystone Coppery of recent weeks has had some people muttering darkly that we are heading the way of a police state. Those who style themselves as defenders of ancient British liberties will soon have bigger fish to fry: the digital surveillance tools that government hopes to use to trace the infected. Prepare for dire warnings of state intrusion and an avalanche of Nineteen Eighty-Four quotes on social media warning that Big Brother is upon us.\n\nYet if we are to beat a path out of this pandemic without destroying our economy, overblown concerns about threats to our liberties must be countered by pragmatism. To recover some semblance of normality before a vaccine is found, we must accept the need for the state to access more information about ourselves, our health and our whereabouts — and not waste precious weeks arguing about it.\n\nLook east to see how digital surveillance is an integral part of returning to “normal” life. Hong Kong has mandatory tracking wristbands for those in quarantine. In Taiwan the phone-tracking system is known as an “electronic fence”; those who are meant to be in isolation will be visited by the authorities if their phone is turned off. In South Korea the pooling of data from credit card use, mobile phones and CCTV cameras means that they can detail the movements of an infected citizen down to where they sat in the cinema and which bar they went for a beer in afterwards — and in less than ten minutes can trace and contact the woman who was sitting two stools down. Public support for these measures is high, for the simple reason that they are working.\n\nIn the West, proposals nowhere near as strong as these are meeting serious opposition. Edward Snowden, patron saint of the paranoid, has warned the digital remedy for this disease will become a disease itself, remaining long after we have been given the all-clear for coronavirus. “Privacy advocates” across Europe are determined to thwart what they see as unacceptable levels of state intrusion. Last month there was an outcry in Germany over plans to require mobile phone operators to hand over customer data, forcing the government to pull the proposals and go back to the drawing board for a softer, voluntary alternative.\n\nExpect similar tussles in Britain, where civil liberties pressure groups are particularly noisy — as demonstrated a few years ago by their successful rebranding of a perfectly sensible piece of legislation as “the snooper’s charter”. Any moves to use our data for public health purposes is bound to stir up complaints. Indeed, when a new NHS contact-tracing app was announced last week, the former head of MI5 Lord Evans of Weardale said it was a “very intrusive set of proposals” that would be a “real intrusion into people’s private lives”.\n\nSuch dark warnings seem strangely out of date in an age when we all endlessly volunteer data about ourselves, unthinkingly click “I agree” to the box that pops up with every website we visit, and send information about our wants and desires to big tech companies, who monetise this information. To be comfortable selling our digital souls to Facebook and co and not to our government — which has a clear and life-saving reason for wanting some basic information — would be nonsensical.\n\nThe real problem with the NHS app as proposed is that it doesn’t go far enough. It has two major flaws. First, it relies on self-diagnosis, which — given the number of hypochondriacs out there — will be painfully inexact. Such a system needs to be paired with testing on a huge scale to be of any real use. The second issue is that this is voluntary. To be properly effective, over 80 per cent of smartphone users must take it up, a heroically ambitious target given that Singapore’s similar Tracetogether app only had take-up of 12 per cent.\n\nThe government must explore less comfortable terrain, beyond voluntarily downloaded apps. Last week a draft memo was leaked suggesting that alternatives included “making use of existing apps and other functions already installed on people’s phones (eg Google Maps)”. Following the leak, the health service’s digital wing fell over itself to deny this: “To be very clear — there have never been [such] plans”.\n\nWhy should such defensiveness be necessary? Using smartphone tracking, with all the expected caveats about ensuring anonymity, seems a perfectly proportionate measure given that thousands are dying and parts of our economy are being read the last rites. Indeed, last week an Ipsos Mori poll found that 65 per cent of people agreed with using smartphones to identify those who had been diagnosed, and work out who they had been in contact with.\n\nAnother idea that may raise the heart rate of privacy campaigners but which would be useful in the UK’s recovery from this crisis is biometric ID cards. The health secretary has suggested that, down the line, immunity passports may be used to prove the status of those who have overcome the virus. Yet wouldn’t these be too vulnerable to forgery or theft? Far better to have an unforgeable, untransferable, unique document. ID cards would also provide a much richer source of data with which to trace the infected; South Korea’s comprehensive national identity system has been an important part of its success.\n\nThe creation of a national ID card system would not exactly be fast work, but who knows how long this crisis will continue or if future pandemics will occur? Besides, this a good idea beyond the current crisis; a stone to kill multiple birds, from voter fraud to welfare abuse, identity theft to illegal immigration (once citizens need a card to access bank accounts, housing and healthcare it will be much harder to melt into anonymity). There will always be high-profile huffing and puffing about such measures, but under that noise is the quiet pragmatism of the British public, who understand that some mild incursions on our privacy may be necessary for the sake of public health. The most recent poll on the subject found that a majority would support even the compulsory carrying of ID cards.\n\nBritain has been too slow on many fronts in the first weeks of this crisis. We must now take seriously the example of other nations who have successfully restored some normality to life, and rapidly develop a system of digital surveillance that is comprehensive and useful enough to map and break chains of infection extremely quickly.

More than 60,000 people petitioned the White House to remove Ortiz from office for \"overreach.\" On January 15, 2013, following his suicide, all charges against Swartz were dropped.The next day, Ortiz issued a statement saying that her office had never intended to seek maximum penalties against Aaron Swartz. \n\nHowever, the same day, Ortiz's husband, IBM executive Tom Dolan, scolded the Swartz family for issuing a statement criticizing the prosecutors and MIT. He rationalized: \"Truly incredible that in their own son's obit, they blame others for his death and make no mention of the 6-month offer.\" Esquire writer Charlie Pierce replied, \"the glibness with which her husband and her defenders toss off a 'mere' six months in federal prison, low-security or not, is a further indication that something is seriously out of whack with the way our prosecutors think these days.”",

      ">During the campaign, Biden pledged to undo former president Donald  Trump’s hard-line immigration policies. In his first month in office,  Biden signed several executive orders reversing many of those policies.  Last week, he and House Democrats introduced a plan that would provide a  path to citizenship for 11 million undocumented immigrants. The  administration also reversed some of Trump’s expulsion practices by  accepting unaccompanied children into the country, a change that also is  contributing to an increase of minors in government facilities,  officials said. \n\nSo I did some digging to find out what this was referencing, and I guess it's about a facility being reopened under Biden to house teens. This article does include several quotes critical of the move. But like with most things, it's more nuanced than a tweet would suggest. \n\nThe thing to focus on isn't the existence of facilities or not, but what is happening there. If you have immigrants or refugees you have to put them somewhere, otherwise the alternative is letting them be homeless. The article goes on to mention that the facilities are supposed to meet certain guidelines for occupancy and that the children are united with family in country if possible while they await immigration proceedings. \n\nThe controversy surrounding Trump's handling was about separating children from families, overcrowding in facilities, and forcing refugees to wait in Mexico for their hearings where conditions were even more dangerous. If Biden is successful in addressing those issues then that is a step in the right direction, but is obviously still not a long term solution to the immigration problem. But then again it's only been 1 month since inauguration. \n\n[https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/immigrant-children-camp-texas-biden/2021/02/22/05dfd58c-7533-11eb-8115-9ad5e9c02117\\_story.html](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/immigrant-children-camp-texas-biden/2021/02/22/05dfd58c-7533-11eb-8115-9ad5e9c02117_story.html)",

WHY he killed himself is a different story, I suspect that it was out of fear of his choices, testify against the next one up the ladder and be punished, or prison being punished in a different way. \n\n\nHunters laptop and Hillary's emails? I honestly haven't followed much about the laptop, I recall something about child porn but didn't Giuliani sit on it (not immediately reporting CP is a crime of it's own) and then nothing came out after that? There comes a point where Hunter Biden just seems like something that's thrown around whenever it seems helpful. The coke and alcohol stuff isn't good, but then again GWB has alcohol and drug history as well, that never came up (so far as I'm aware) as he grew in politics. Barisma? Shouldn't have done it on optics alone. He may have been hired with hopes of gaining access to his father, him selling that access is yet to be answered with anything specific. I'm sure there will be another thing or two about him that come up over the next four years, and each one will be new and different with the same aim of casting doubt about his father. \n\n\nHillary's emails - I honestly don't know what to say about this anymore. Investigations on top of investigations. Partisan investigations nonetheless. Anything deleted without bleach bit would have been just as big an issue for it being unsecure. The email server was a bad idea, but not illegal then as it is now. 30k emails (a number that keeps changing and somehow is identified without having the emails) missing from her server - they were sent to people. And out of 30k missing emails and who knows how many recipients not a single one comes forward with a chunk of their own? Even if we had those emails I honestly don't know what we're looking for because it's become about the emails existing, nothing about their content seems to come up anymore. \n \n\nRussian collusion - vague. Are we talking about origin of the investigation or origin of any actual collusion? If you don't think Russia is in some way trying to influence our elections/politics I suggest you take a breath and learn a little bit about international politics, especially Russian geopolitics. Now someone here on the inside helping? Can be anything from an asset that's being manipulated and doesn't know it, an agent directly trying to inject Russian influence/coordination into the mix. And I say this for both major political parties, it's about making a mess, not picking sides.  I also hold a view that there should be near constant investigation of the executive to encourage transparency (but not with hunts ffs). \n\n\n\nA few people have also mentioned the Vegas shooter. Why does this have to be something with a political aim or whatever conspiracy is tied to it. Think about serial killers, they perform acts of violence too. One at a time, but we don't question that as a conspiracy of some sort. The Vegas shooter may very well have been a random act of mass violence. Unfortunately this isn't something impossible. One could argue it's even inevitable. That's the scary part to me, people can actually fly off the handle and do things like that without any sort of external control or influence. External control or influence makes it far more likely, but isn't an exclusive cause. \n\n\n\nThat's all I've got. Agree or disagree, personally I enjoy the disagreement more - way more productive conversation, but at least bounce the thoughts around for a moment before accepting or dismissing them.

      "I think at this point we should probably face it, people. I'd say it's a 50/50 chance that Bernie was just a pawn: a man with a good track record who was hired by the DNC to collect money from millenials that could then be turned over to the Clinton campaign.\n\nAnd if he didn't know he was doing it, then I can almost guarantee you that is why the government was allowing Bernie to do it and why the media was backing him so vehemently earlier this year. It was to galvanize the greatest number of young voters and polarize them to the left.\n\nBernie's submission and the abrupt media about-face are being blamed on reactionism to Donald Trump--and again, I'm sure this is an overt motive--but the ulteriors suggest that this was calculated from the start, just as they gave Trump a chance so that he could draw votes away from other anti-establiishment candidates to pave the way for Jeb Bush.\n\nThe thing is, I think in both cases the establishment underestimated that wilfulness and pent-up anger of the population. Bernie nearly spiraled out of control, but fortunately his main opponent was an establishment candidate, and the establishment has engineering a 1v1 win in the bag.\n\nTrump was a different story. After he made Jeb and Marco look like fools, there were only anti-establishment candidates running. At this point, I think that they actually *selected* the most outrageous candidate to win the nomination, making  the easiest path to victory for Clinton, their establishment candidate.\n\nAt this point, they're pulling out a lot of stuff on trump that they were supposed to use to help Jeb win months ago, especially the hot mic scandalous recording that was provided by [a member of the Bush family](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Bush).\n\nThis logic is the only reason I want to vote Trump.

    "title": "This week I was banned from 400+ subreddits in a day. I broke no rules and never even posted in most of them. The two power mods that did this to me have been power-tripping for years and they're the exact type of authoritarian stooges that fit right in with Reddit CEO Ellen Pao's new reddit. -- Last weekend I posted [an article](https://i.imgur.com/0sBNlhT.png) about a possible religious hate incident to /r/europe. An hour later I was banned from /r/europe, /r/HistoryPorn, /r/history, /r/bestof and /r/food by power mod /u/davidreiss666. I was later banned by power mod /u/agentlame from hundreds of subreddits even though I broke no rules in any of them. I asked both of them and the other mods what was going on and [this was the response.](http://imgur.com/a/cRJRk) I was issued global bans from the numerous subreddits that these mods control for having opinions that they personally disliked. They wrongly slandered me as a racist and banned me for saying things outside of the subreddits they mod that they didn't like and this is in keeping with their past tyrannical behavior. [This isn't the first time we've seen this type of mod abuse for having opinions/views that mods don't personally agree with and being labeled a racist for holding them in an effort to eliminate dissent and/or open discussion.](https://imgur.com/a/cQE96) davidreiss666 has been purging and censoring opinions on reddit that don't align with  his Leftist views for as long as he has had power here. He corruptly ran /r/politics before being thrown out and he mods Left wing subreddits like /r/postnationalist, /r/Green, /r/Liberal, /r/labor, and /r/neoprogs (New progressives). Here is his rap sheet as one of reddit's most dictatorial, biased, and corrupt mods.\n\n[In 2012, davidreiss666 was responsible for serious mod drama that led to a near-meltdown in /r/Canada. He was constantly removing posts, spamming the subreddit with Left wing posts with his secret alt account, and banning users who posted views that went against his Left wing positions. The entire subreddit turned on him and eventually managed to push him out of the mod team.](https://imgur.com/a/tKwtX) [He is so bad that he managed to have a reddit admin kick him out of /r/ideasfortheadmins because he was up to no good.](http://i.imgur.com/T0Fy5vw.png)\n\n[He has a history of the same type of behavior in /r/europe as well.](https://imgur.com/a/fKYZV) The last screenshot is from voat.co and was posted by a user this week who noticed what davidreiss666 has been doing in /r/europe and how he is trying to control the subreddit just like he did with /r/Canada before he was thrown out of there. [Here is a link to that post from voat.co for you to read.](https://voat.co/v/MeanwhileOnReddit/comments/98027)\n\nIt doesn't stop there. In what was probably his most blatant act of abuse and corruption, in 2013 he used his mod power to censor people exposing his shady moderation of and posting in /r/politics. He caused immense drama and got serious attention on the front page of reddit for trying to get rid of someone who got tons of upvotes for calling him out as a spammer and shill in /r/politics. /r/politics was removed as a default subreddit by the admins because of mods like davidreiss666 running it in a way that allowed him to create what has to be the biggest political echo chamber filled with Left wing bias on the entire internet.\n\n[One,](https://i.imgur.com/j3mYRZp.png) [two,](https://i.imgur.com/OcUioEr.png) [three,](https://i.imgur.com/tFhlu5P.png) [four.](https://imgur.com/a/O4ymS)\n\n[Read the comments in this /r/SubredditDrama thread about this incident to really see what this guy is about.](https://np.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/1ckgu1/bestof_links_to_rmurica_comment_calling_out_the/) \n\nHis behavior hits close to home for those of us here at /r/conspiracy as well since [he was the mod responsible for banning links from this subreddit to /r/bestof.](https://i.imgur.com/aE8jT1p.png) He is lying when he says that the other /r/bestof mods \"agreed\" with the banning since it doesn't matter what any other mod thinks because he is the de facto top mod of the subreddit. The mods above him pay no attention to /r/bestof and are inactive.\n\nHe happens to be friends with and mods subreddits with agentlame. Both of them were in part responsible for the total meltdown of /r/technology in Summer 2014 that led to the admins temporarily having to remove its default status. [Here is a good look at the way these two moderate together.](https://imgur.com/a/aOMHl)\n\nI posted this today because I have had enough of the wrong turns that reddit has been taking recently with its many biased, authoritarian, and terrible moderators. I felt the need to share this information with all of you just in case you weren't aware of how bad the problem has gotten on this site. Between mods like this and Ellen Pao forcing this site to become [a \"safe space\" instead of a place for the most open and engaged discussion on the web,](http://imgur.com/a/Ib6kT) I felt the need to show those who don't know about two of reddit's most dictatorial mods just how perfect they are for the new reddit under Ellen Pao. \n\nAs for my bannings and the reasons given by these two mods, I reject their view that I am a racist and that I deserve to be banned from every subreddit that they moderate for this accusation. I make no apologies for and do not reject the view that I hold conservative and right of center opinions on certain issues. I reject the notion that the views I hold are inappropriate, that I have no right to participate in discussion in the many subreddits that these mods control due to my views, and I know that the censoring of myself and others for holding these views is the wrong way to run subreddits that are supposed to be places for open and varied discussion. \n\nI'm not advocating for the right to spam racial and/or other hateful slurs in a subreddit. I'm not demanding the right to yell \"FIRE!\" in a crowded theater or subreddit either. I'm staunchly in favor of the right to hold opinions that cut against the grain and that challenge others to think and to address beliefs that may not be popular or widely-held. I actually believe that the reason why I was banned from hundreds of subreddits is because these two mods were angry that people were giving [positive attention to the views that I hold](https://imgur.com/a/TG1uY) since my views apparently do not align with their own.\n\nIf I have to choose between a safe space where my ideas aren't challenged or deemed worthy of sharing, where I have to walk on eggshells not to push the envelop too far, or where I have to think twice about every \"controversial\" view that I hold before posting then you can count me out. I like a reddit where we're all able to post freely without any sort of coercion from mods or admins that makes us alter or sanitize what we say and/or to scare us from saying anything at all that would be deemed inappropriate by biased, authoritarian neckbeards like davidreiss666 and agentlame. If you've read this far, I hope you're in favor of the latter reddit and not the former.\n\nEdit: The top comment in this thread is telling me that /r/subredditcancer is the place for this type of post so I will post this over there as well. \n\nEdit: I've just been told that /u/davidreiss666 is talking about this post in his backroom private subreddits with his other power mods and his sycophants who are telling him he's not to blame for anything that I've exposed and dug up here. He's such a coward that he won't respond to this post in any public subreddit where people can challenge his poor behavior but he'll act like he's not a piece of garbage in his private subreddits with other authoritarian neckbeards just like him who all tell each other that it's everyone else who is the problem reddit but not them.",

      "Has anyone looked through OP's comment history? He talks a lot about race and has certainly posted some comments that some may interpret as racist: \n\n> TIL that nations, races, and ethnicities have no right to want to keep their societies homogeneous and that they're racist when they don't cave to the demands of the diversity mob. There's nothing racist about wanting to live in a homogeneous society. Typically, it's White nations in the Western world that have diversity pushed on them but if you look around you'll notice that the diversity mob and the Left never demand diversity in non-White places.\n\nAnother post:\n\n> Because CNN does a shitty job at acting like they're not biased and pushing the liberal narrative. I think they would be better suited covering actual racial hate crimes like a pack of Black teenagers attempting to murder an innocent White Baltimore man amid the Baltimore riots. Won't hear about that on national news outlets because it ruins the \"Black people literally did nothing wrong unlike White people\" narrative that gets pushed relentlessly by our mainstream media. These \"teens\" have been charged with attempted murder yet a racial hate crime like this gets no media attention. Instead, CNN and our media need to create White-on-Black racial crimes out of nothing because our media is trash.\n\nAnd another:\n\n> I don't think the police have said that they \"hunt\" black men. If they look at them with suspicion it is because Black males comprise about 6 percent of America's population but commit about a third of the nation's crime. The incarceration rate for Black males is about seven times higher than that of White males. Would it be wrong for airport screeners and the TSA to look at Muslim or Middle-Eastern passengers with increased suspicion given the climate of terrorism in today's world?\n\nMost of this stuff is borderline, but I would imagine that OP has deleted the stuff he doesn't want people to see.

Rebuttals and arguments flowed and the karma didn't matter. Then slowly but surely the usual suspects realized that open debate doesn't serve their purpose because they usually lose. Censorship is much more effective. Now the majority of popular subreddits are simply sanitized of controversial topics and comments by mods who believe that they know what is best. And what should and shouldn't be discussed. It sucks. And it is literally the cancer that is killing reddit. You are just the latest casualty."

      "**THE ORIGINS OF CORPORATE SOCIALISM**\n\n“Old **John D. Rockefeller** and his 19th century fellow-capitalists were convinced of one absolute truth: that no great monetary wealth could be accumulated under the impartial rules of a competitive laissez faire society. **The only sure road to the acquisition of massive wealth was monopoly: drive out your competitors, reduce competition, eliminate laissez-faire, and above all get state protection for your industry through compliant politicians and government regulation.** This last avenue yields a legal monopoly, and a legal monopoly always leads to wealth.\n\nThis robber baron schema is also, under different labels, the socialist plan. The difference between a corporate state monopoly and a socialist state monopoly is essentially only the identity of the group controlling the power structure. **The essence of socialism is monopoly control by the state using hired planners and academic sponges. On the other hand, Rockefeller, Morgan, and their corporate friends aimed to acquire and control their monopoly and to maximize its profits through influence in the state political apparatus; this, while it still needs hired planners and academic sponges, is a discreet and far more subtle process than outright state ownership under socialism.** Success for the Rockefeller gambit has depended particularly upon **focusing public attention upon largely irrelevant and superficial historical creations, such as the myth of a struggle between capitalists and communists,** and careful cultivation of political forces by big business. We call this phenomenon of **corporate legal monopoly—market control acquired by using political influence—by the name of corporate socialism.**\n\nThe most lucid and frank description of corporate socialism and its mores and objectives is to be found in a 1906 booklet by Frederick Clemson Howe, Confessions of a Monopolist.”\n\n“What is the secret of making great wealth? Howe answers the question as follows: \"Mr. Rockefeller may think he made his hundreds of millions by economy, by saving on his gas bills, but he didn't. He managed to get the people of the globe to work for him....\"\n\n“In brief, **corporate socialism is intimately related to making society work for the few.”**\n\n[Wall Street and FDR](https://archive.org/details/pdfy-FPUkz4pezsfsrVfZ/mode/2up)\nAntony C.

The Royal Lancers own a lot of real estate, including the Bohemian Grove and a lot of land in the Southwestern United States. The land in the SW United States is operated by a chapter of the Royal Lancers known as the Bohemian Club (if I’m not mistaken on the exact name, but I know the Royal lancers are the umbrella organization). The Bohemian club is an ages old “hunters guild” and is rooted in mystery.\n\nEdit: Kubrick knew the above and that is why he used the pseudo name used in today’s MSM papers “Larry Celona” in his film. He knew that it was an anagram for the Royal Lancers, the guys who own the bohemian grove and more land around the world. He was aware of the cult without a doubt. This was a recent discovery for many of us who had no clue for years. This may be one of the reasons he was killed - he successfully outed the name of a major cult organization that is esoteric to even the most adept occult researchers. By having the same fake Larry Celona report on his actual death, they sent a telling message to those in the know: If you’re one of us, have a laugh.

      "I'm somewhat torn on the whole Kaepernick situation.  \n\nOn one hand I totally respect his right to voice his protest and actually find it refreshing to see a high profile person using their platform to bring awareness to legitimate issues that are dividing our country.  \n\nOn the other hand, he waited to take his stand until after his $12m salary was guaranteed, which I can give him a pass for I suppose - I certainly wouldn't risk losing out on that kind of pay day.  However, I can't shake the feeling that his primary motivation is to force the 49ers to cut or trade him.  Three years ago he was THE MAN - a young QB on the rise leading his team to multiple conference championship games and a Super Bowl.  \n\nNow, due to the fact that he's failed to show the expected growth for someone at his position and his apparent \"me first\" attitude that has alienated some of his teammates and his coaches - he's an albatross around the 49ers neck - a lot of guaranteed money on the books and he's not getting it done on the field, to the point where he lost the starting job and isn't in the running to win it back.  In addition to that he's got an injury guarantee in his contract that basically states that if he's injured he gets all of the guaranteed money left on his contract ($61m I think) as opposed to earning it through performance incentives and playing time if he's healthy (guaranteed money isn't always guaranteed in the NFL - worst Union on Earth).\n\nSo what that all means is that he won't get close to the field this year, the 49ers are going to do to him what Washington did to RGIII last season.  I fear all of this noise he's making is more of a self serving attempt to be a distraction and get cut or traded and be able to play football again as opposed to a selfless show of solidarity.  Maybe I'm wrong, or maybe it doesn't matter.\n\nTl/dr:  It's good to see a pro athlete speak out, just not so sure Kaepernick would be so vocal if he were the starting QB.",

      "Foreword - Amusing ourselves to death - Neil Postman\n\r\nWe were keeping our eye on .1984. When the year came and the prophecy \r\ndidn't, thoughtful Americans sang softly in praise of themselves. the \r\nroots of liberal democracy had held. Wherever else the terror had \r\nhappened, we, at least, had not been visited by Orwellian nightmares. \r\nBut we had forgotten that alongside Orwell's dark vision, there was \r\nanother--slightly older, slightly less well known, equally chilling: \r\nAldous Huxley's Brave New World. Contrary to common belief even among \r\nthe educated, Huxley and Orwell did not prophesy the same thing. Orwell \r\nwarns that we will be overcome by an externally imposed oppression. But \r\nin Huxley's vision, no Big Brother is required to deprive people of \r\ntheir autonomy, maturity and history. As he saw it, people will come to \r\nlove their oppression, to adore the technologies that undo theircapacities to think. \r\nWhat Orwell feared were those who would ban books. What Huxley feared \r\nwas that there would be no reason to ban a book, for there would be no \r\none who wanted to read one. Orwell feared those who would deprive us of \r\ninformation. Huxley feared those who would give us so much that we \r\nwould be reduced to passivity and egoism. Orwell feared that the truth \r\nwould be concealed from us. Huxley feared the truth would be drowned in \r\na sea of irrelevance. Orwell feared we would become a captive culture. \r\nHuxley feared we would become a trivial culture, preoccupied with some \r\nequivalent of the feelies, the orgy porgy, and the centrifugal \r\nbumblepuppy. As Huxley re \r\nmarked in Brave New World Revisited, the civil libertarians and\r\nrationalists who are ever on the alert to oppose tyranny \"failed to take \rinto account man's almost infinite appetite for distractions.\" In 1984, \r\nHuxley added, people are controlled by inflicting pain. In Brave New \r\nWorld, they are controlled by inflicting pleasure. In short, Orwell \r\nfeared that what we hate will ruin us. Huxley feared that what we desire will ruin us.",

The discussions, comments, and posts, can't be taken for authentic, fleshed out, comprehensive, or free in any sense. I hate that reddit has done this. Let the people talk you elitist fucks",
      "My theory is slightly different from the ones in this thread. So let's start with it IS Epstein's body and he IS dead. For decades he has been in the inner circle of politicians, royals, celebs and the real power people. He was thee man. Wealth and influence beyond our comprehension. He was untouchable. Even when authorities got close, his punishment was a token gesture. \n\nMy thoughts are, the people who suicided him didn't want it wrapped up tight. They wanted the exact reaction they desired. They knew through design it would be precisely this. When all is said and done the official narrative may say suicide. But the world will know otherwise. It is a threat hidden in plain sight.\n\nThe message is clear. \"If anyone with any real information/evidence regarding the nefarious goings on of us elites and you are contemplating exposing us.....Look at what we did to someone at the top of the tree and how easy it was. You are certainly not out of our reach.\"\n\nJust my opinion, but to me the whole thing feels more like a message than a jailbreak or cover up.",

They're fucking spoonfeeding this to people because they know people are suspicious. They can't try to sell any bullshit about how it was a legit suicide. HOWEVER, Epstein is fucking alive, and they got him out of prison and faked his death guaranteed and that's the real conspiracy. They're happy we are all acting like we \"caught\" them with this \"murder\" conspiracy.",

People like that DO NOT commit suicide. They have too much to live for and they know where there's money there's a way.

      "The media is in collusion with the US military/industrialists.\n\nBack during the Vietnam War, the US government was forced to quit due to the free press. In the US, people were seeing raw footage from the front lines and not liking what they were seeing. Napalmed kids, burnt up villages, mentally fatigued soldiers, etc..\n\nCouple that with civil rights activists, there was a lot of people pissed off and protesting. The military lost the Vietnam war because the press wasn't controlled.\n\nWhen the US invaded Grenada, they banned the press and used field reporters. The press core busted them lying so they had to let reporters back in.\n\nBetween the 70s and 80s, cable and satellite expanded. You went from 3 networks to a ton of new specialty networks.\n\nIn 1996, the FCC killed off 70 year old anti-monopoly laws.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecommunications_Act_of_1996\n\nDue to that, it led to the big media outlets being able to expand, which they did.\n\nFox News came out like a month or 2 after the FCC decision.\n\nWhen the US invaded Iraq back in 91, CNN covered the war extensively. They used embedded journalists but used live feeds with a delay. CNN was criticized for not being objective and acting more like cheerleaders than journalists.\n\nWhen the US invaded Iraq following 911, they again used embedded reporters but that stopped due to Geraldo Rivera writing troop movements on live tv. After that, the networks covered the war by using military spokespeople and instead of live footage, they switched to stock footage.\n\nAll of these big media companies tend to have worked with the military/government by helping sanitize war coverage and keep people from turning into anti-war activists.\n\nThese big ass companies are neither left nor right. They're corporate capitalists. Technically, they'd lean more right than left but that's irrelevant due to the fact that they all work together to further their own initiatives.\n\nNews is supposed to be unbiased. It's just supposed to relay information and let people determine for themselves. Nowadays, news is painfully polarized & partisan.\n\nWhen FOX News started up, the rest of the US was leaning fairly left since Clinton was in office and the economy was in decent shape. FOX saw a niche market in pandering to right wing people.\n\nOther networks did the same thing only with left wing markets.\n\nNowadays with the overall domination of corporate media ownership, most social issues are somewhat controlled and rigged as a form of manufactured dissent. Liberal teens argue with old conservatives over stupid shit like racism and religion while other issues like war and economics are completely ignored.",

      "I remember when this was first discovered/posted on r/conspiracy back when she was arrested in 2020 and the account suddenly went dark. It was fascinating to watch it come together in real time. \n\nThis information had better be a part of the prosecution's case in the trial. I'll tell you why.\n\nI'm 99% sure personally that /u/maxwellhill was Lady Ghislaine herself. I also am about 75% sure Aaron Swartz unearthed EVERYTHING related to Jeffrey&Ghislaine/Intelligence Agencies/human trafficking/political blackmail/Moloch when he hacked the MIT research lab, which Jeffrey was a prominent associate of. \n\nAaron hacked the private servers there and found something he was NOT supposed to find and was soon charged with such extreme punishments by the court system which led to his suicide (I have no reason to think he was assassinated, but of course it wouldn't surprise me. Look up [the relationship between Courtney Love and her father/The Grateful Dead/CIA/MKUltra](https://covertactionmagazine.com/2021/07/21/u-s-intelligence-coverup-newly-declassified-fbi-file-on-nirvanas-kurt-cobain-compounds-evidence-implicating-his-wifes-role-in-his-murder/). Kurt was likely assassinated by these forces for being a political thorn in their side to a much lesser degree than Aaron was becoming. Smart, skilled young men who competently buck the system are their worst nightmare and must be *crucified*.)\n\nAaron died in 2013 and /u/maxwellhill IIRC showed up as a high level account around 2012. The SOPA/PIPA protests, spearheaded by Aaron and others in his circle, were around 2012 and their success put Aaron on the elites' map in a bad way. Then when he found whatever he found hacking MIT... he became a HUGE problem for their scheme. Poor kid probably had no idea what to do with himself, 26 years old and to discover all this by yourself, and to live with it alone? Think of the emotional trauma we have all endured in the last years as all this has come out... and we've had each other to get through it all. Aaron had no one. He was probably absolutely fucked in the head/heart by the time he died. \n\nYou know, maybe. I don't know 100% if any of this is true. But it sure does add up.\n\nAlso the McGraw-Hill textbook company (the makers of all our K-12 school history textbooks) is owned by the Maxwell family. So /u/maxwellhill controls the narrative just as McGraw-Hill does.\n\nIt's a cute pun, I'll give her that.",
      "I think MaxwellHill is more a play on McGraw-Hill, a company her father Robert Maxwell’s company merged with decades ago, one of their information dissemination ventures. The Maxwells have worked in curating and manipulating information in forms of media ranging from NewsPapers to school textbooks all the way up to owning the software our intelligence agencies used. I always believed it was likely these accounts you’re referring to were operated by a team of people leading to confusing posts where it seems as if multiple people are using it but it is essentially owned by Maxwell and is her semi personal account.",

      "Great work OP. I can tell you care about this, and damn it do I respect it. \n\nI do have one small gripe, though. You suggest that she was working for Epstein. Are we 100% sure she wasn’t the one that was actually pulling the strings, given her family’s history and the intelligence connections/family business? I think that’s a pretty decent probability in my opinion, but I’m just throwing it out there as food for thought. \n\nNot a counter point per se, but I think we’re doing ourselves a disservice if we don’t consider some different possibilities with this situation. \n\nAnd given the possible manufactured nature of Epstein’s persona (nobody knows where he got his money, seems to just show up in power circles, is handled by law enforcement as an intelligence asset, and is disappeared/murdered when captured, to name a few), I’ve caught myself wondering if Epstein himself was not a propped up, ready to go expendable patsy. I could even see a scenario where he may have thought he was setting up pedophiles, like working for law enforcement. \n\nJust to be clear, I’m NOT saying I believe that, I’m just saying there seems to be a lot more nuance to this situation than a lot of people want to acknowledge. That is all. I believe in casting a wide net and working from that. Nothing more, nothing less. I think it helps. \n\nThat certainly would not make him a good guy (just to be clear, again lol), but when you think of this case that way, it opens up some interesting possibilities. To believe that Epstein was the pinnacle here (in any way) is to take our eyes off the ball. This guy was working for some entity. \n\nMy point in saying this is, Epstein most definitely could be just a prop and always a cut out to take the fall, that is a well known practice for these types. I think there is just as much to indicate that Maxwell was the one in charge as there ever was that Epstein was the head of this. Or it could go much deeper than that (very likely, IMO). \n\nThanks again for posting, OP. And take all of what I’ve typed here with a spirit of being helpful, because that is how it is meant.",

In US/Canada deep fried slices of potato are French Fries, in the UK and some other places they're called chips.\n\nAlso mentions crisps. In this instance, crisps refers to potato chips. Again, \"crisps\" suggests an English speaker from the UK or from some place with a colonial British (English language) heritage.\n\nAnd even more interesting is the fact that this user is *still* listed on the worldnews mod team. Been inactive for how long yet they're still there?\n\nThat's suggestive of some kind of extremely \"special status\".",
      "So, I presume everyone who hangs out in a place like this, understands *what* exactly Ghislaine Maxwell and Jeff Epstein *were*. They were spies, working for a foreign nation, who utilized child sex slaves as one means of extortion and control over their targets. Their targets included at least one US administration, which they successfully controlled. They also included field-leading scientists in areas ranging from genetics through cryptography, media, social media, all the way to orbital launch and space flight. \n\nIn the world of espionage there are assets, agents who develop the assets, case officers who develop and manage the agents, and powers that tell the case officers what to do. Layers of separation meant to keep the hands of the shot-callers clean. Epstein was an asset; Maxwell was an agent. Both, quite obviously, worked for Mossad. The Maxwell-Epstein team even targeted Elon Musk, though apparently unsuccessfully, much like the Bronfman-sponsored NXIVM mind control/sex traffic cult team successfully targeted Richard Branson of Virgin fame, even celebrating their capture by holding parties on Branson's private island. [They had predecessors](https://i.imgur.com/gH04jOb.jpg) who controlled previous US administrations through similar means. The existence of such creatures across the breadth of US history suggests that there are most likely teams doing similar things currently in operation. One such team recently targeted congressman Matt Gaetz; their operation was disrupted and two members of their team are already in federal custody. The rest are known.\n\nNow you must understand something else. While Ghislaine Maxwell's cell of this team has been deactivated, there are remnant cells in the form of Maxwell's sisters, who wrote much of the code the US government uses at a federal level to track the movements of people, keep out terrorists, and keep the borders of America secure. This granted the Maxwell team the ability to traffic in humans in undetectable fashion around the world, as well as facilitate the completely clandestine movements of VIPs around the world. In short, not the kind of people you want in charge of your fundamental natsec backbone software. Now you understand why Maxwell had a pilot's and a submariner's license. Now you understand why Nadia Marcinkova, another member of the Maxwell-Epstein team, remains a pilot, and remains at large. Now you understand why all the other members of the Maxwell-Epstein team are still at large: they're completely in charge of your government, those higher powers that tell the cells what to do and whom to target.\n\nWoodrow Wilson had a relevant quote about these hidden powers."

    "summary": [
      "They are coming for the rest of what we have. They have already taken hold of freedom, money, food, land and laws. Now they want your water aswell.",
      "state level water use isn't measured in gallons, it's measured in acre-feet - the amount of water it takes to cover one acre to a depth of one foot. One acre-foot is 325,851 gallons. Nestle, in fact, extracted much more than 27,000,000 gallons, that's just what they got from some natural springs. All told it's closer to 100,000,000 gallons, which is a whopping 300 acre-ft. \n\nBetween 2011 and 2014 california averaged overdrafting (extracting at faster than natural replenishment rate) their aquifers by *12,000,000 acre-feet per year.* Nestle's 300 acre-feet is a whopping .0025% of that. Those monstrous monsters.\n\nResidential water use accounts for roughly 10% of the state's total water demand, with the average use in the vicinity of 400gphd (gallons per household per day). So, Nestle's 100 million gallons a year is equivalent to the water consumption of 700 average households. \n\n\"But those households pay a lot for that water, and this headline says Nestle pays almost nothing!\" you think. Well, there's a reason for that. Those households buy water from the tap, gathered and processed and etc. for them. Nestle owns their own wells, and does their own processing. All they're supposed to be paying for is permits. \n\nNow, if this article is correct and Nestle has been operating without the proper permits, well, that's a problem, and they should be fined appropriately. It's got fuck-all to do with the drought, though, and frankly \"company has expired permit; fine issued\" isn't exactly an exciting news story.\n\nNestle is not the cause of the drought. Nestle is not making the drought worse. From the way this topic keeps coming up, clearly *someone* just wants everyone to focus on Nestle.",

It'll be the very last thing I want to drink in this life.  18 ounces mix, I cup milk and I'm set.\n\nThe point is this,, there is a finite amount of water on this earth, it never changes, it just might change location. Fighting against something when it's a problem is just going into the ring during the 4th round in an Ali fight when he's in his groove without you even being a boxer. See things before they become an issue. It might not help with Nestle, but in the meantime other things are happening that will be an issue coming up. The tiny bit of water Nestle uses wouldn't add shit to the growing population with ever growing need. If you stopped Nestle right this minute, what would happen? Suddenly there are more houses and more showers built and the same and greater demand suddenly replaces the extra water. Nothing changes. Nothing. If people can't learn to conserve, or if the state doesn't learn to live within its means or it innovative ideas aren't tried out to live in nature while not changing it for the worse, it only gets worse.\nWhen you water your lawn, much of what you see evaporates. It doesn't disappear forever, and when it goes into the ground, slowly but surely it returns to the water table to be used again. The bad part and a real issue concerning water use is water that is used but becomes contaminated, mixed with oil, pesticides, and other environmentally and physiologically harmful substances. These come from stupid greedy companies and people. So when the water runs out, they can't keep expanding, and people can't work. Point being that better use practices would avoid that desperation. Fix or redesign that which is causing something to break. don't keep replacing the part over and over. That leads to stagnation and blindness towards the future.\n\nStrawberry Quick, so artificial, so delicious.",

This is a very serious privacy matter you ALL need to be aware of! -- For such a massive thing, I've only heard echos about it. Not even whispers and this is a really big problem. As if we didn't need another reason to despise Reddit Inc. even more and as if they didn't need to give Aaron Shwartz another reason to roll over in his grave (RIP), Reddit Inc. gives us and Aaron yet another reason. \n\nReddit Inc. is about to strike a deal with one of the most powerful censorship fueled companies in the world. This company is the SAME company that worked/works hand in hand with China to build the infrastructure upon which China deploys its' intense censorship controls. \n\nThe company is called Tencent, \"the first ever Asian technology company to pass a $500 billion market value.\" Journalist Patrick Howell O'Neill, a journalist employed by gizmodo, states that \"the apparently impending Reddit-Tencent marriage is complicated by the fact that Reddit, one of the most popular websites on the internet, is regularly—and is currently—blocked in China as part of the world’s most notorious and sophisticated censorship regime, the Great Firewall of China.\"\n\nPatrick goes on to say, \"Tencent is, at great cost and ultimately for great profit, literally reinventing censorship in China. The Great Firewall was not built by the Communist Party in Beijing, it’s built by the tech giants all around China. This opaque but clearly powerful relationship between the $500 billion company and the Chinese government raises interesting and unanswered questions about Tencent’s forays into the West, including questions about Reddit’s future.\" \n\nHe goes on to say, \"Reddit, which in the recent past had numerous executives say the company stood “for free speech,” is of course not alone in receiving the Tencent cash. In addition to Snap and Discord, Tencent’s accelerating investment program has grabbed a piece of over 600 diverse companies globally.\"\n\nTo read the full article I am quoting from and get more information, **[click here](https://gizmodo.com/reddit-banned-in-china-is-reportedly-set-to-land-150-1832375439)**\n\nSo what does this all mean? It means a variety of things. It means that Reddit Inc. will now be controlled and operated by one of the largest censorship ran companies in the world. A company that works hand in hand with China to censor it's citizens and control what they see and do not see.

      "FTA:\n\n>“The algorithms to perform this kind of image filtering are computationally expensive in terms of time and energy,” report author Jeffrey Knockel said. “Performing this type of filtering is the last thing Tencent wants to be wasting money on, but the fact that it does suggests that there is a large amount of pressure Tencent receives from the Chinese government to implement it.”\n\nSounds like they are buying the only thing better than AI at censorship. \n\nVolunteer Reddit Moderators!",
      "Anyone around for the 2016 election saw drastic changes in their communities. It was the first effort to sway public opinion on the web en mass. My only hope is that those who pay attention hold firm in face of the apocalypse. What we grew up with and made us strong is now being used against us. Information is freedom.",
      "Here's some background from someone who has been close to a couple of this kind of deal (no ties to reddit or Tencent other than the fact that I use reddit and a few Tencent games and services).\n\nThe first thing you need to understand is that virtually *no companies from outside China are allowed to do business in China*. This sounds absurd, and we can all point to dozens of counter-examples, right? Well... no. The companies that you *think* do business in China are actually forced to \"partner\" with a Chinese firm that licenses their brand(s) and then re-sells their product/services/etc. within China in order to gain a license to do any more than have a sales agreement with a Chinese firm. [Ching 2009]\n\nDepending on the specific deal, the company might be a subsidiary that the original company creates or it might be an existing Chinese company, but there are restrictions on how it has to be managed and how much of its leadership needs to be Chinese citizens.\n\nSo, if you see ANY Western company in China, they must be doing this, or they had some kind of really phenomenal leverage in China that allowed them to get special exceptions from the government. I don't know of any examples of that happening, but I'm sure it has happened once or twice. Reddit is certainly not going to have that kind of leverage. (note that this is slightly untrue, when talking about some legacy arrangements in Hong Kong, but that's a special case and doesn't give companies access to the broader Chinese market)\n\nSo, enter Tencent. They've been quietly positioning themselves as a mostly hands-off holding company focusing on gaming and social media that can serve in this role, but because they're cash-rich from having made several key investments in mobile and PC gaming spaces, they're in a position to be the bigger fish in many of these transactions, and so it's more of an investment into or acquisition of the Western companies than it is a partnership (example, Tencent's majority stake in Grinding Gear Games, [Takahashi 2018] makers of [Path of Exile](https://old.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/), recently).\n\nFinally, let's talk censorship. One of the points of this gatewaying of Western companies into China is to simultaneously create a barrier to Western spying on China and to inject Chinese surveillance/censorship elements into incoming products and services. Mostly this is in order to make sure that the Chinese government maintains the ability to monitor and manage its own citizens who currently live under a Black Mirror-worthy system of point-based citizenship, earning points by falling in line and losing points via dissent or disruption. Lose enough points and you go to jail for \"re-education\" and jail in China isn't just a matter of harsh conditions. It can mean that you are killed and your organs harvested... I have to stop, here, and stress that this is not the plot to a science fiction novel about a dystopian future. This is literally how China rolls. [Sharif 2014]\n\nSo, on the plus side, Reddit, Inc. shouldn't necessarily be seen as seeking to become a people-monitoring behemoth in the West necessarily. The reason for this is almost certainly that they are looking to do business in China as a standard part of their social media landscape. BUT there are massive concerns that should arise, not the least of which is the fact that Tencent is a huge corporation that will exert far more influence over the Western side of reddit than would be the case were reddit opening up a Chinese subsidiary. That being said, Tencent has, to date, been mostly hands-off when it comes to the Western counterparts of their partner/subsidiary companies.\n\nAs for wiping history, etc. Don't bother. If you honestly think that you can erase your participation in reddit, should this deal spell the beginning of Chinese harvesting of Western user data, then you're living in a fantasy world. In reality, we all knew that for years (ever since the canary died [Volz 2016]) that WESTERN surveillance of reddit was game-on. If you want your data out of the hands of spooks, then you shouldn't be contributing here and shouldn't have been for years, or you should at least be going through some form of anonymizing process that you know you can trust (assume that most commercial such services are run by the people you're looking to evade).\n\nBottom line, this is big news, but expected and with predictable results that aren't actually much worse than what we already contend with by being here.\n\n----\n\n##References:\n\n* Ching, Mia Kuang.

      "You're absolutely right but it's a much more extensive issue that your post taps into: namely, the way that the environmental movement (and all of the various environmental groups like Greenpeace) was hijacked by corporations to push the global warming narrative, which has completely overshadowed every other environmental issue for activists, and which pins the blame on workers and lower classes and let's the corporations escape blame, justice, or all responsibility for cleaning up the damage they have done to the planet.  \n\nIt started with the Thatcher government in the UK, she deliberately funded research to prove carbon emissions had a negative impact so that she could break the backs of the coal miners who were striking.  It was a deliberate strategy to completely destroy organized labour and it worked, and her counterpart in USA Ronnie Ray-Gun was busy doing the same thing, dismantling any corporate controls and regulations while simultaneously destroying organized labour.  Both were agents of the new corporate tyranny. \n\nThe Gilets Jaunes movement in France encapsulates this perfectly: how it's a class issue, and how the global warming legislation hurts working class people.\n\nEnvironmental Activists used to protest major corporations and financial institutions and government institutions, nuclear power plant protests, factory farms, oil refineries, hijacking pipelines etc, but what happened with this psyop is that the shift led to the faux activism of Greta and Extinction Rebellion (which again attacks working class people by blocking them from going to work etc) which mostly replaced and distracted from the real issues.\n\nThe entire debate has been reframed with \"deniers\" on one side and on the other side if you care about the environment then you affirm the official narrative and therefore agree with the laws.  Both sides are incorrect, because the entire framing is incorrect.\n\nThe way I approach it is I simply focus on the more existential and urgent environmental issues, like microplastics in every living being on the plant for instance, and 99% of the time these are the direct result of multinational corporations.\n\nSo take the environmental position, but just sidestep the framing and address the real issues: nobody can attack you for actually caring about the environment, and instead of getting distracted by entangling yourself in the pro or con global warming game, just step back and realize it's a psyop.\n\nPeople are being pushed to fear something that isn't concretely evident to them, a narrative that isn't intuitive (the idea that carbon which is necessary for plants is dangerous and an existential threat -- which by the way I'm neither affirming nor denying, I'm simply stating that you can't see it with your own eyes so it becomes a \"trust the experts\" issue) while the things that are concretely evident like plastic pollution are being demoted to the bottom of the concern list.  But people can see, with their own eyes, the way that giant corporations are destroying the planet.  The evidence is overwhelming.\n\nNow the next step is to realize that this exact same formula and process applies to every other major issue, from war to immigration.\n\n Start with the shift from class to race/ identity:\n\nFrom 2008-10 there was mass mobilization of workers and activism focused on class (the 99% vs the 1%) where the masses were joining together and attacking wallstreet and giant corporations. \n\nSo again we see the exact same pattern: the Occupy movement being hijacked and overshadowed by BLM and LGBTQ identity politics, and also the exact same formula applies to the Covid-19 narrative and the risks and dangers of the virus and also the vaccine.  The MO is the same (and it also happened in the 60s with COINTELPRO).\n\nIt's crystal clear once you put it together.\n\nChomsky's Manufacturing Consent outlines the Modus Operandi for all of these propaganda and psyop campaigns pushed through by corporate media",

We can't let the DNC's election fraud go unpunished because it somehow helps 'the left' get a better candidate than Joe Biden for their presidential elections.\n\nOr our government's [unwarranted accusations of 'espionage' against Julian Assange](https://youtu.be/8tsvZHCfQlM) for exposing war crimes. We cannot be silent and allow Julian Assange to be unjustly murdered in prison because we trust that Trump will do the right thing and pardon him (or that he makes our government look bad). There have been no signs showing he will, [in fact, quite the opposite.](https://youtu.be/7n7VyHbqkas) \n\nWe must start there IMO, if we are to root out this evil from our government.

Often my mood is fine and I have no problem with the world, I just can't think straight and feel like I'm hungover and confused. \n\nAntidepressants help stabilise this function so you're always around a middle ground 5/10. It restricts your ability to feel the highs of life, in order to make sure you don't sink too low - it doesn't change my thoughts or how I perceive the world. Treatment for being super sad is therapy, which is non medical and helps you manage the problems in your life and how you react to them. \n\nClinical depression is a real, medical condition that can be treated and I don't like it being belittled.

Herridge and the network’s team of investigative journalists traveled across the United States and to Yemen to complete an **eighteen-month investigation into al-Awlaki**, who was linked to three of the 9/11 hijackers, the Fort Hood attack, the attempted bombing on Christmas Day 2009, the failed attack on Times Square in May 2010, and the cargo printer bomb plot in October 2010. “The Washington Post” described the resulting documentary as “an explosive hour.”\n*  **Among her exclusives**: a **classified State Department cable sent in August 2012 by Ambassador Chris Stevens** warning Secretary Clinton’s office that the consulate could not withstand a coordinated assault. Secretary Clinton, Secretary Panetta, and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Gen. Martin Dempsey were all pressed during House and Senate hearings on Benghazi about the cable’s warning, and whether they acted upon it. **The classified cable foreshadowed how Ambassador Chris and three other Americans would die on 9/11.**\n\n ",
      "Since Russia is being blamed for the emails getting out and accused of manipulating the elections, I cant help but laugh since the US meddles and tries to influence literally every election that they think matters, even going so far as to replace entire governments with puppets. Why are we so salty when someone tried to do it back to us?"

      "On the morning of September 11, 2001, 19 men armed with boxcutters directed by a man on dialysis in a cave fortress halfway around the world using a satellite phone and a laptop directed the most sophisticated penetration of the most heavily-defended airspace in the world, overpowering the passengers and the military combat-trained pilots on 4 commercial aircraft before flying those planes wildly off course for over an hour without being molested by a single fighter interceptor.\n\nThese 19 hijackers, devout religious fundamentalists who liked to drink alcohol, snort cocaine, and live with pink-haired strippers, managed to knock down 3 buildings with 2 planes in New York, while in Washington a pilot who couldn’t handle a single engine Cessna was able to fly a 757 in an 8,000 foot descending 270 degree corskscrew turn to come exactly level with the ground, hitting the Pentagon in the budget analyst office where DoD staffers were working on the mystery of the 2.3 trillion dollars that Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld had announced “missing” from the Pentagon’s coffers in a press conference the day before, on September 10, 2001.\n\nLuckily, the news anchors knew who did it within minutes, the pundits knew within hours, the Administration knew within the day, and the evidence literally fell into the FBI’s lap. But for some reason a bunch of crazy conspiracy theorists demanded an investigation into the greatest attack on American soil in history.\n\nThe investigation was delayed, underfunded, set up to fail, a conflict of interest and a cover up from start to finish. It was based on testimony extracted through torture, the records of which were destroyed. It failed to mention the existence of WTC7, Able Danger, Ptech, Sibel Edmonds, OBL and the CIA, and the drills of hijacked aircraft being flown into buildings that were being simulated at the precise same time that those events were actually happening. It was lied to by the Pentagon, the CIA, the Bush Administration and as for Bush and Cheney…well, no one knows what they told it because they testified in secret, off the record, not under oath and behind closed doors. It didn’t bother to look at who funded the attacks because that question is of “little practical significance“. Still, the 9/11 Commission did brilliantly, answering all of the questions the public had (except most of the victims’ family members’ questions) and pinned blame on all the people responsible (although no one so much as lost their job), determining the attacks were “a failure of imagination” because “I don’t think anyone could envision flying airplanes into buildings ” except the Pentagon and FEMA and NORAD and the NRO.\n\nThe DIA destroyed 2.5 TB of data on Able Danger, but that’s OK because it probably wasn’t important.\n\nThe SEC destroyed their records on the investigation into the insider trading before the attacks, but that’s OK because destroying the records of the largest investigation in SEC history is just part of routine record keeping.\n\nNIST has classified the data that they used for their model of WTC7’s collapse, but that’s OK because knowing how they made their model of that collapse would “jeopardize public safety“.\n\nThe FBI has argued that all material related to their investigation of 9/11 should be kept secret from the public, but that’s OK because the FBI probably has nothing to hide.\n\nThis man never existed, nor is anything he had to say worthy of your attention, and if you say otherwise you are a paranoid conspiracy theorist and deserve to be shunned by all of humanity. Likewise him, him, him, and her. (and her and her and him).\n\nOsama Bin Laden lived in a cave fortress in the hills of Afghanistan, but somehow got away. Then he was hiding out in Tora Bora but somehow got away. Then he lived in Abottabad for years, taunting the most comprehensive intelligence dragnet employing the most sophisticated technology in the history of the world for 10 years, releasing video after video with complete impunity (and getting younger and younger as he did so), before finally being found in a daring SEAL team raid which wasn’t recorded on video, in which he didn’t resist or use his wife as a human shield, and in which these crack special forces operatives panicked and killed this unarmed man, supposedly the best source of intelligence about those dastardly terrorists on the planet. Then they dumped his body in the ocean before telling anyone about it. Then a couple dozen of that team’s members died in a helicopter crash in Afghanistan.\n\nThis is the story of 9/11, brought to you by the media which told you the hard truths about JFK and incubator babies and mobile production facilities and the rescue of Jessica Lynch.\n\nIf you have any questions about this story…you are a batshit, paranoid, tinfoil, dog-abusing baby-hater and will be reviled by everyone. If you love your country and/or freedom, happiness, rainbows, rock and roll, puppy dogs, apple pie and your grandma, you will never ever express doubts about any part of this story to anyone. Ever.",

His older brother, Jonathan, said he believed Michael was experiencing a \"manic episode\" shortly before his death, and that he may have had suspicions were it not for this observation.\n\nCenk Uygur, friend of Hastings' and host of The Young Turks, told KTLA that many of Michael's friends were concerned that he was \"in a very agitated state\", saying he was \"incredibly tense\" and worried that his material was being surveilled by the government. Friends believed that Michael's line of work led to a \"paranoid state\". USA Today reported that in the days before his death, Hastings believed his car was being \"tampered with\" and that he was scared and wanted to leave town.\n\n...unquote.\n\nThe boring explanation that he was suffering a mental health episode and drove too quickly seems far more likely in this circumstance.

We wanted to investigate how does someone like Harvey Weinstein gets away with doing what…get away with criminality, essentially. And the network that surrounds him. We decided that Gio would interview a concierge in Las Vegas. During the interview, I revealed that basically Gio has molested an eight-year-old boy. Now, mind you, this is extreme comedy and we thought that the guy would leave the room. Instead, this concierge stays in the room and I go, listen, you’ve got to help me get rid of the problem. And this guy starts advising Gio how to get rid of this issue. We even at one point talk about murdering the boy, and the concierge is just saying, ‘well, listen, I’m really sorry. In this country, we can’t just drown the boy. This is America we don’t do that.’ And then, in the end, he puts me in touch with a lawyer who can silence the boy. I became really dark stuff. And then at the end of the interview I say, listen, I want to go out and celebrate now. Can you get me a date for tonight? He says, ‘what do you mean, a date?’\n\nI go, you know, like a young man. He says, ‘well, what kind of age?’ I say, lower than Bar Mitzvah but older than eight. And he says, ‘yeah, I can put you in touch with somebody who can get you some boys like that.’\n\nDEADLINE: None of this remotely qualifies as comedy. What did you do?\n\nBARON COHEN: We immediately turned over the footage to the FBI because we thought, perhaps there’s a pedophile ring in Las Vegas that’s operating for these very wealthy men.

      "Lol, to have universal healthcare, you first need to crush corporate/billionaire control over healthcare and regulators in order to crush insanely high prices.\n\nVoters will never insist on that because about half will be easily led by the nose on any subject imagineable.  No one even debates high prices, they simply argue over the impossible task of paying, should it be from tax dollars, insurers, etc.  There is no real debate.  The people who can't be led will be distracted with something to be angry about.  \"Lower drug prices means more kids will be able to afford hormone therapy!\". \"If pfizer can't make insane profits from the vaccines, how will they develop other products that don't work?\"",
      "Ted Cruz makes a great point about this. Healthcare comes down to 3 things, Cost, Quality, and Availability. All nations at best can only have 2 of these things. Those 32 nations have picked Cost and Availability at the expense of Quality. America has picked Quality and Availability. Our major problem in America is cost because of the insurance companies having a monopoly. You can't buy say Maryland insurance in Texas. You can only buy Texas insurance. There's basically no competition. One way to make this better is to open competition, but TPTB will never allow that.\n\nIn short, pick your poison.

Plaintiff was hired as a “seasonal” spa attendant to work at the Mar-a-Lago Club in the fall of 2000 after she had turned 17.\n\nPage 195\n\n\\- DEFENDANT’S PURPORTED FACTS 11. One of the non-parties Ms. Giuffre “named” repeatedly in the joinder motion was Ms. Maxwell. According to the “lurid details” of Ms. Giuffre included in the motion, Ms. Maxwell personally was involved in a “sexual abuse and sex trafficking scheme” created by Epstein: § Ms. Maxwell “approached” Ms. Giuffre in 1999 when Ms. Giuffre was “fifteen years old” to recruit her into the scheme. § Ms. Maxwell was “one of the main women” Epstein used to “procure under-aged girls for sexual activities.” § Ms. Maxwell was a “primary co-conspirator” with Epstein in his scheme. Case 18-2868, Document 281, 08/09/2019, 2628234, Page6 of 66 7 § She “persuaded” Ms. Giuffre to go to Epstein’s mansion “in a fashion very similar to the manner in which Epstein and his other co-conspirators coerced dozens of other children.” § At the mansion, when Ms. Giuffre began giving Epstein a massage, he and Ms. Maxwell “turned it into a sexual encounter.” § Epstein “with the assistance of” Ms. Maxwell “converted \\[Ms. Giuffre\\] into . . . a ‘sex slave.’” Id. Ms. Giuffre was a “sex slave” from “about 1999 through 2002.” § Ms. Maxwell also was a “co-conspirator in Epstein’s sexual abuse.” § Ms. Maxwell “appreciated the immunity” she acquired under Epstein’s plea agreement, because the immunity protected her from prosecution “for the crimes she committed in Florida.” § Ms. Maxwell “participat\\[ed\\] in the sexual abuse of \\[Ms. Giuffre\\] and others.” § Ms. Maxwell “took numerous sexually explicit pictures of underage girls involved in sexual activities, including \\[Ms. Giuffre\\].” Id. She shared the photos with Epstein. § As part of her “role in Epstein’s sexual abuse ring,” Ms. Maxwell “connect\\[ed\\]” Epstein with “powerful individuals” so that Epstein could traffic Ms. Giuffre to these persons. § Ms. Giuffre was “forced to have sexual relations” with Prince Andrew in § “\\[Ms. Maxwell’s\\] apartment” in London. Ms. Maxwell “facilitated” Ms. Giuffre’s § sex with Prince Andrew “by acting as a ‘madame’ for Epstein.” § Ms. Maxwell “assist\\[ed\\] in internationally trafficking” Ms. Giuffre and “numerous other young girls for sexual purposes.” § Ms. Giuffre was “forced” to watch Epstein, Ms. Maxwell and others “engage in illegal sexual acts with dozens of underage girls.”\n\nPage 234\n\n\\- Picture of Maxwell, prince Andrew drew and Giuffre.\n\n\\- Ms Giuffre travel records are incomplete, many examples. She was being flown by them without keeping records some of the time\n\nPage 243\n\n\\- Detective Recarey knew that Maxwell was involved in the illegal sexual activities at Epstein's house. He wanted to speak to her, but Maxwell did not return his calls. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 13, Recarey Dep. Tr. at 28:23-29:10.\n\n\\- A walk through video taken during the execution of the search warrant revealed photos of topless females at the home, and there was even a photograph of Maxwell naked hanging in the home. The house staff who were deposed in the civil cases each testified to Maxwell being the boss in charge of everyone in the house. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibits 1, Case 18-2868, Document 281, 08/09/2019, 2628234, Page55 of 66 56 19, 21, Banasiak Dep. Tr. at 8:21-9:16; 14:20-15:6; Alessi Dep. Tr. at 23:11-23:20; Rodriguez Dep. Tr. at 169:1-169:4.\n\nPage 244\n\n\\- Rodriguez, the house butler from 2004 through 2005, a time period that revealed daily sexual abuse of underage females, testified that Maxwell kept a list of the local girls who were giving massages at her desk, and that Maxwell kept nude photos of girls on her computer. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 21, Rodriguez Dep. Tr. at 238:4-238:22; 302:19-303:10; 306:1- 306:24.\n\n\\- Recarey testified that when the search warrant was executed, the house had been sanitized and the computers removed from the home. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 13, Recarey Dep. Tr. at 72:25-73:15.\n\n\\- Banaziak testified that the computers were removed by Adriana Ross, another employee who answered to Maxwell. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 19, Banaziak Dep. Tr. at 54:7-22.\n\nPage 245\n\n\\- Tony Figueroa, Ms. Giuffre's ex-boyfriend, did testify that Maxwell personally requested that he find and bring girls to Epstein for sex once Ms. Giuffre had escaped, and that when he brought the girls Maxwell interacted with them. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 4, Figueroa Dep. Tr. at 200:6-18; 228:23-229:21.\n\n\\- Rodriguez testified unequivocally that Maxwell was \"the boss\" and that she knew everything that was going on. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 21, Rodriguez Dep. Tr. 169:1-169:4.\n\n\\- Nude photographs were displayed throughout Epstein’s home. Furthermore, Alfredo Rodriguez testified to Maxwell having pornography on her computer. Rodriguez Dep. Tr. 150:10-17; 306:1-306:24.\n\n\\- He also testified to there being a collage of nude photos in Epstein's closet. Id. 253:14-254:18. That collage was eventually taken into evidence by Detective Recarey, who testified to that fact in his deposition. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 13, Recarey Dep. Tr. at 73:19-73:24.\n\n\\- **And those photos are still in the possession of the FBI or US Attorney's Office. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 13, Recarey Dep. Tr. at 74:2-74:7.**\n\n\\- Ronaldo Rizzo, who visited the home on numerous occasions and who was reprimanded by Maxwell herself for looking at the nude photos. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 14, Rizzo Dep. Tr. at 25:19-26:20.\n\nPage 246\n\n\\- Johanna Sjorberg testified that the Defendant bought her a camera for the specific purpose of her taking nude photos of herself. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 16 Sjoberg Tr. at 150.\n\n\\- Virginia Giuffre testified that there was a nude photograph of her at the house. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 5 Virginia Giuffre Tr. at 232 and 333.\n\nPage 264\n\n\\- Johanna Sjoberg, testified that Defendant recruited her under the guise of a legitimate assistant position, but asked her to perform sexual massages for Epstein, and punished her when she didn’t cause Epstein to orgasm.\n\n\\- Tony Figueroa testified that Defendant contacted him to recruit high school-aged girls for Epstein, and also testified that Maxwell and Epstein participated in multiple threesomes with Virginia Giuffre.\n\n\\- the butler for Defendant’s close friend witnessed, first-hand, a fifteen-year-old Swedish girl crying and shaking because Defendant was attempting to force her to have sex with Epstein and she refused.\n\n\\- Call this the “yes-I’m-a-sextrafficker-but-only-of-sixteen-year-old-girls” defense.\n\nPage 265\n\n\\- Flight logs even reveal twenty-three flights that Defendant shared with Ms. Giuffre – although Defendant claims she is unable to remember even a single one of those flights.\n\n\\- Defendant’s heavy and extensive involvement in both Jeffrey Epstein’s sex trafficking ring and in recruiting Ms. Giuffre, living with her and Jeffrey Epstein in the same homes while Ms. Giuffre was a minor, and traveling with Ms. Giuffre and Jeffrey Epstein – including 23 documented flights. Even the house staff testified that Defendant and Ms. Giuffre were regularly together.\n\nPage 266\n\n\\- The record evidence in this case shows that Defendant shared a household with convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein for many years. While there, she actively took part in recruiting underage girls and young women for sex with Epstein, as well as scheduling the girls to come over, and maintaining a list of the girls and their phone numbers.\n\n\\- Ms. Giuffre was indisputably a minor when Defendant recruited her to have sex with convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein. Thereafter, Ms. Giuffre flew on Epstein’s private jets – the – Lolita Express” – with Defendant at least 23 times.\n\n\\- Ms. Sjoberg’s account of her experiences with Defendant are chillingly similar. As with Ms. Giuffre, Defendant, a perfect stranger, approached Ms. Sjoberg while trolling Ms. Sjoberg’s school grounds. She lured Ms. Sjoberg into her and Epstein’s home under the guise of a legitimate job of answering phones, a pretext that lasted only a day. A young college student, Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page12 of 74 5 nearly 2,000 miles from home, Defendant soon instructed Ms. Sjoberg to massage Epstein, and made it clear that Sjoberg’s purpose was to bring Epstein to orgasm during these massages so that Defendant did not have to do it.\n\nPage 268\n\n\\- Ms. Sjoberg also testified about sexual acts that occurred with her, Prince Andrew, and Ms. Giuffre, when she and Defendant were staying at Epstein’s Manhattan mansion.\n\n\\- **Prince Andrew using a puppet to touch Ms. Giuffre’s breast while using a hand to touch Ms. Sjoberg’s breast.**\n\n\\- Tony Figueroa testified that Plaintiff told him about threesomes Ms. Giuffre had with Defendant and Epstein which included the use of strap-ons.\n\nPage 269\n\n\\- Figueroa also testified that Defendant called him to ask if he had found any other girls for Epstein, thereby acting as procurer of girls for Epstein:\n\nPage 270\n\n\\- Mr. Rizzo testified - through tears – how, while working at Dubin’s house, he observed Defendant bring a 15 year old Swedish girl to Dubin’s house. In distress, the 15 year old girl tearfully explained to him that Defendant tried to force her to have sex with Epstein through threats and stealing her passport.\n\nPage 271\n\n\\- Lyn Miller is Ms. Giuffre’s mother. She testified that when Ms. Giuffre started living with Defendant, Defendant became Ms. Giuffre’s “new momma.” 10 Incredulously, Defendant testified that she barely remembered Ms. Giuffre.\n\n\\- Detective Recarey led the Palm Beach Police’s investigation of Epstein. He testified that Defendant procured girls for Epstein, and that he sought to question her in relation to his investigation, but could not contact her due to the interference of Epstein’s lawyer.\n\nPage 272\n\n\\- Notably, at Defendant’s deposition, Defendant refused to admit that she flew with Ms. Giuffre, and denied that she appeared on Epstein’s pilot’s flight logs.13\n\n\\- However, David Rodgers, Epstein pilot, testified that the passenger listed on his flight logs bearing the initials – GM – was, in fact, Ghislaine Maxwell, and that he was the pilot on at least 23 flights in which Defendant flew with Plaintiff. 14 The dates of those flights show that Ms. Giuffre was an underage child on many of them when she flew with Defendant.\n\n\\- Both Sarah Kellen and Nadia Marcinkova lived with Jeffrey Epstein for many years. They both invoked the Fifth Amendment when asked about Defendant’s participation in recruiting underage girls for sex with Epstein.\n\nPage 273\n\n\\- Jeffrey Epstein invoked the Fifth Amendment when asked about Defendant’s involvement in procuring underage girls for sex with him.\n\nPage 274\n\n\\- Defendant has not been able to procure a single witness - not one – to testify that Defendant did not procure girls for sex with Epstein or participate in the sex.\n\n\\- Even one of her own witnesses, Tony Figueroa, testified that she both procured girls and participated in the sex.\n\n\\- Another one of Defendant’s witnesses, Ms. Giuffre’s mother, named Defendant as Ms. Giuffre’s “new mamma.” Indeed, those who knew her well, who spent considerable time with her in Epstein’s shared household, like Juan Alessi, Alfredo Rodriguez and Joanna Sjoberg, have testified that she was Epstein’s procuress.\n\n\\- Others who lived with her – Jeffrey Epstein, Nadia Marcinkova, and Sarah Kellen – invoked the Fifth Amendment so as not to answer questions on the same. No one has testified to the contrary.\n\n\\- **Defendant has never offered a legal explanation for what she was doing with, and why she was traveling with, a minor child on 21 flights while she was a child, including 6 international flights, aboard a convicted pedophile’s private jet all over the world.**\n\nPage 275\n\n\\- Defendant never offered an explanation regarding Ms. Giuffre’s photographs of her, Defendant, and Epstein.\n\n\\- She never offered a legal explanation for why Prince Andrew was photographed with his hand around Ms. Giuffre’s bare waist while she was a minor child, while posing with Defendant, inside Defendant’s house in London.\n\n\\- This photograph corroborates Ms. Giuffre’s claims, and there is no other reasonable explanation why an American child should be in the company of adults not her kin, in the London house owned by the girlfriend of a now convicted sex offender.\n\n\\- Ms. Giuffre also produced pictures of herself taken when she was in New York with Defendant and Epstein, and from a trip to Europe with Defendant and Epstein.\n\nPage 276\n\n\\- Ms. Giuffre has produced a number of pictures of herself taken at the Zorro Ranch, Epstein’s New Mexico Ranch.\n\n\\- Among other nude photos, which included full nudes of Defendant, Ms. Giuffre produced images of females that the Palm Beach Police confiscated during the execution of the 22 See McCawley Dec at Exhibit 42, GIUFFRE007175; 007173. Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page22 of 74 15 warrant, including one photograph revealing the bare bottom of a girl who appears to be prepubescent.\n\nPage 277\n\n\\- In 2008, the United States Attorney’s office for the Southern District of Florida identified Ms. Giuffre as a protected “victim” of Jeffrey Epstein’s sex abuse. The U.S. Attorney mailed Ms. Giuffre a notice of her rights as a crime victim under the CVRA.\n\n\\- Ms. Giuffre has provided extensive medical records in this case, including medical records from the time when Defendant was sexually abusing and trafficking her. Ms. Giuffre produced records supporting her claim of being sexually abused in New York resulting in both 23 See McCawley Dec at Exhibit 44, GIUFFRE007584. 24 See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 30, GIUFFRE 002216-002218, Victim Notification Letter.

The dates on the hospital records show she was seventeen years old.\n\nPage 278\n\n\\- Defendant propounded wildly overbroad requests for production concerning the past eighteen years of Ms. Giuffre’s medical history. Defendant repeatedly and vehemently argued to the Court that it was essential to procure every page of these records in a fanfare of unnecessary motion practice\n\n\\- Defendant propounded wildly overbroad requests for production concerning the past eighteen years of Ms. Giuffre’s medical history. Defendant repeatedly and vehemently argued to the Court that it was essential to procure every page of these records in a fanfare of unnecessary motion practice.\n\n\\- Ms. Giuffre sought counseling from a psychologist for the trauma she continued to experience after being abused by Defendant and Epstein. A 2011 psychological treatment record, written by her treating psychologist, unambiguously describes Defendant as Ms. Giuffre’s abuser.\n\nPage 279\n\n\\- Years before Defendant defamed her, Ms. Giuffre confided in her treating psychologist that Maxwell recruited her for sex with Epstein.\n\n\\- Detective Recarey, the lead investigator of the criminal investigation into Epstein and his associates’ sex crimes, recovered carbon copies of hand-written messages taken by various staff, including Defendant, at Epstein’s Palm Beach residence.\n\n\\- The messages raise a question of fact as to Maxwell’s involvement in the sexual abuse of minors and are relevant to refute Maxwell’s denial of any involvement with Epstein during relevant time periods, and, accordingly her denial of knowledge of certain events.\n\nPage 280\n\n\\- Messages reveals that Maxwell, “GM,” took messages at the residence, including from underage girls who were calling to schedule a time to come over to see Epstein.\n\nPage 282\n\n\\- One message pad reflects , who is identified in the Palm Beach Police Report as a minor, contacting Jeffrey Epstein for “work” explaining that she does not have any money. The term “work” was often used by members of Jeffrey Epstein’s sexual trafficking ring to refer to sexual massages.\n\n\\- Giuffre 001462: July 5th no year to JE from ”I need work. I mean I don’t have money. Do you have some work for me?”\n\n\\- Other message pads reflect who was a minor, calling and leaving a message at the Palm Beach mansion that she has recruited another girl for Jeffrey Epstein. The second message demonstrates that Jeffrey Epstein required different girls to be scheduled every day of the week. The third shows an offer to have two minor girls come to the home at the same time to provide sexual massages. These type of messages indicate the lack of secrecy of the fact that multiple young females were visiting every day and at least raises a question of fact whether Maxwell was knowledgeable and involved as Giuffre has said, or whether Giuffre was lying and Maxwell was not at all involved or aware of this activity, as Defendant would attempt to have the world believe\n\n\\- Giuffre 001428 – undated Jeffrey From – “Has girl for tonight” ;Giuffre 001432 (pictured above)– 7/9/04 – Mr. Epstein From – “ is available on Tuesday no one for tomorrow”; GIUFFRE 001433 /1/17/04 – Mr. Epstein from – “Me and \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ can come tomorrow any time or alone” ; Giuffre – 001452 – undated Jeffrey from “Has girl for tonight.”\n\n\\- Other message pads demonstrate that there was a pattern and practice of using young females to recruit additional young females to provide sexual massages on a daily basis.\n\n\\- Giuffre 001413 (pictured above)– JE from “N” – “ hasn’t confirmed for 11:00 yet, so she is keeping on hold in case doesn’t call back; Giuffre 001448 -8/20/05 JE from - confirmed \\_\\_\\_ at 4 pm. Who is scheduled for morning? I believe wants to work.”\n\n\\- This message pad reflects that a friend of Jeffrey Epstein is sending him a sixteen year old Russian girl for purposes of sex.\n\n\\- Giuffre 001563 (pictured above)- 6/1/05 For Jeffrey From Jean Luc “He has a teacher for you to teach you how to speak Russian. She is 2X8 years old not blonde. Lessons are free and you can have your 1st today if you call.”\n\nPage 283\n\n\\- This message pad directly refutes Maxwell’s sworn testimony that she was not present during the year 2005 at Jeffrey Epstein’s Palm Beach mansion because this shows leaving a message for Jeffrey at the Palm Beach home that she was going to work out 30 See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 28. Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page28 of 74 21 with the Defendant on September 10, 2005. The police were only able to retrieve a fraction of these message pads during their trash pull but even in the few they recovered, it shows Maxwell was regularly at the Palm Beach home during the time period she claimed she was not. To the contrary, she was both sending and receiving messages and messages, like this one, reflect her presence at the mansion.\n\n\\- Giuffre 001412 – 9/10/05 (during the year Maxwell says she was never around) JE from – “I went to Sarah and made her water bottle and I went to work out with GM.”\n\n\\- These message pads further corroborate that Defendant lied in her testimony and she was in fact in regular contact with Jeffrey Epstein during the years 2004 and 2005. For example, the message from “Larry” demonstrates that Defendant is at the Palm Beach mansion so frequently that people, including Epstein’s main pilot Larry Visoski, are leaving messages for Maxwell at the Palm Beach house.\n\n\\- Giuffre 001435 7/25/04 – Mr. Epstein from Ms. Maxwell – “tell him to call me”; Giuffre – 001449 – 8/22/05 – JE from GM; Giuffre – 001453 – 4/25/04 for Ms. Maxwell From Larry “returning your call”;\n\n\\- This message pad shows that Defendant was clearly actively involved in Jeffrey Epstein’s life and the activities at his Palm Beach mansion.\n\n\\- Giuffre – 001454 – undated Jeffrey From Ghislaine – “Would be helpful to have \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ come to Palm Beach today to stay here and help train new staff with Ghislaine.”\n\n\\- This message pad clearly reflects an underage female (noted by the police redaction of the name) leaving a message asking if she can come to the house at a later time because she needs to “stay in school.”\n\n\\- ” Giuffre 001417 (pictured above)– Jeffrey 2/28/05 Redacted name “She is wondering if 2:30 is o.k. She needs to stay in school.”\n\n\\- This message pad reflects a message from who was under the age of eighteen at the time she was going over to Jeffrey Epstein’s home to provide sexual massages according to the Palm Beach Investigative Report.\n\n\\- Giuffre 001421 3/4/05 to Jeffrey from “It is o.k. for to stop by and drop something?”\n\n\\- These message pads reflect the pattern of underage girls (noted by the police redaction of the name on the message pad) calling the Palm Beach mansion to leave a message about sending a “female” over to provide a sexual massage.\n\n\\- Giuffre 001423 11/08/04 To Mr. JE – redacted from – “I have a female for him”Giuffre 001426 (pictured above) – 1/09/05 JE To JE from Redacted – “I have a female for him.”\n\nPage 284\n\n\\- This message pad reflects the pattern and practice of having young girls bring other young girls to the house to perform sexual massages. Indeed the “ ” reflected in this message pad corresponds in name to the ” that Tony Figueroa testified he initially brought to Jeffrey Epstein during the time period that the Defendant was requesting that Tony find some young females to bring to Jeffrey Epstein’s home. See Figueroa at 184- 185. The Palm Beach Police Report reflects that “ ” and “ ” also brought seventeen year old to the home to perform sexual massages. See GIUFFRE 05641. thereafter recruited a number of other young girls to perform sexual Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page29 of 74 22 massages as reflected in the Palm Beach Police Report.\n\n\\- Giuffre 001427 (pictured above) – 1/2/03 – JE from “Wants to know if she should bring her friend with tonight.”\n\n\\- This message pad reflects multiple sexual massages being scheduled for the same day which corroborates Virginia GIUFFRE, and Johanna Sjorberg’s testimony that Jeffrey Epstein required that he have multiple orgasms in a day which occurred during these sexual massages.\n\n\\- Giuffre 001449 (pictured above) – 9/03/05 JE from – “I left message for to confirm for 11:00 a.m. and for 4:30 p.m.”\n\n\\- This message pad shows a friend of Jeffrey Epstein’s discussing with him how he had sex with an 18 year old who had also been with Jeffrey Epstein.\n\n\\- Giuffre – 001456 (pictured above)– undated JE from Jean Luc – “He just did a good one – 18 years – she spoke to me and said “I love Jeffrey.”\n\n\\- Law enforcement was able to confirm identities of underage victims through the use of the names and telephone numbers in these message pads\n\nPage 285\n\n**The Black Book**\n\n\\- Palm Beach Police confiscated an extensive lists of contacts with their phone numbers form Defendant and Epstein’s residence.32 Ghislaine Maxwell maintained a contact list in an 31 See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 13, Recarey Dep. Tr. at 42:14-43:17; 78:25:-79:15. Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page30 of 74 23 approximately 100-page-long hard copy, which was openly available to other house employees.\n\n\\- It consisted primarily of telephone numbers, addresses, or email addresses for various personal friends, associates, employees, or personal or business connections of Epstein or Defendant. Prior to being terminated by Defendant, the Palm Beach house butler Alfredo Rodriguez printed a copy of this document and ultimately provided it to the FBI.\n\n\\- This document reflects the numerous phone numbers of Defendant, Epstein as well as staff phone numbers.\n\n\\- Additionally, and importantly, there are several sections entitled “Massage” alongside a geographical designation with names of females and corresponding telephone numbers. These numbers included those of underage females (with no training in massage therapy ) – including – identified during the criminal investigation of Epstein. This document is an authentic reflection of the people who were associated with Epstein, Defendant, and the management of their properties, and the knowledge each had of the contents of the document.\n\n**Sex Slave Amazon.com Book Receipt**\n\n\\- Detective Recarey authenticated an Amazon.com receipt that the Palm Beach Police collected from Jeffrey Epstein’s trash.\n\n\\- The books he ordered are titled:\n\n(1) SM 101: A Realistic Introduction, Wiseman, Jay;\n\n(2) SlaveCraft: Roadmaps for Erotic Servitude – Principles, Skills and Tools by Guy Baldwin; and (3) Training with Miss Abernathy: A Workbook for Erotic Slaves and Their Owners, by Christina Abernathy, as shown below: 32 See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 45, Phone List, Public Records Request No.: 16-268 at 2282 – 2288. Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page31 of 74 24\n\n\\- This disturbing 2005 purchase corroborate Ms. Giuffre’s account of being sexually exploited by Defendant and Epstein – not to mention the dozens of underage girls in the Palm Beach Police Report. Additionally, Defendant testified that she was not with Jeffrey Epstein in 2005 and 2006 when he was ordering books on how to use sex slaves; however, record evidence contradicts that testimony.\n\nPage 287\n\n**Thailand Folder with Defendant’s Phone Number**\n\n\\- Defendant also was integral in arranging to have Virginia go to Thailand. While Epstein had paid for a massage therapy session in Thailand, there was a catch.\n\n\\- Defendant told Virginia she had to meet young girls in Thailand and bring her back to the U.S. for Epstein and Defendant.\n\n\\- On the travel records and tickets Defendant gave to Virginia, Defendant wrote on the back the name of the girl Virginia was supposed to meet, and she was also instructed to check in frequently with Defendant as it was further signified by the words “Call Ms. Maxwell (917) !” on Virginia’s travel documents. In this case, Virginia also produced the hard copy records from her hotel stay in Thailand paid for by Epstein.\n\n\\- The FBI report and the Churcher emails reference Ms. Giuffre’s accounts of sexual activity with Prince Andrew that she made in 2011, contrary to Defendant’s argument that Ms. Giuffre never made such claims until 2014.",

    "summary": [
      "SS: There are over 400,000 Catholic priests in the world, the vast majority of which never get a personal audience with the Pope. Strangely, a low-ranking parish priest from Australia who agreed to give evidence against an archbishop accused of concealing child sexual abuse was mysteriously summoned to the Vatican to meet with the Pope before he was due to testify. He was questioned on what he planned to say in court and who was helping him. \n\nThe parish priest was subsequently stripped of his normal responsibilities and was due to be sent to a leper colony in the third world to see out the rest of his life. He committed suicide before he could testify in court, robbing the prosecution of their star witness. This appears to suggest that not only does the church continue to intervene in child sex cases, it does so at the highest levels. Furthermore, it still punishes those who speak out against those who perpetrate or conceal these hideous crimes. In this case, the pressure and punishment appear to have robbed this priest of his will to live.",

I can’t believe people take things at face value and never look and THINK about why/how it happened ",
      "Here’s an interesting comment I found on Facebook. I can’t find the source, so I don’t know... one thing that I do know is, most of the claims this person makes are verifiable with a couple quick google searches. Here it goes. \n\n\"Last night, someone was on radio discussing the Las Vegas shooting and the connection to what is happening in Saudi Arabia.  They are connected.  I'll start at the beginning.\n\nThere was a King named King Fasal who has named a son, Prince AL Waleed, Bin Talal.  King Fasal took ill and named his brother Salman as king in his place.  King Salman has named his son as heir to the throne, instead of his brother's son Prince Al Waleed.  Al Waleed is a Wahhabi. Salman is Suni.  Wahhabi is extreme Islam.  Salman wanted a more modern, non extreme Islam for Saudi.  That's why he named his own son as heir.\n\nIn Las Vegas, Prince Al Waleed owned the upper floors of the Mandalay Bay resort including the 32nd floor.  That was one of the points of shooting at the strip.\n\nI say one of the places, because the witnesses were all correct. There were other locations.  The Mandalay Bay has a Heli Pad on the roof.  That is important, because that was the escape route after the carnage.\n\nPaddock was a pilot.  He was also a gun runner between the Philippines and the US\n\nHe was running guns for Prince Al Waleed. He didn't win at the casino. Those millions came from smuggling.\n\nOn the night of the attack, I found out that King Salman was in Las Vegas. (I didn't know that part until after the show and I received a missing piece of info.)  Salman was at the Tropicana.\n\nThe FBI knew Paddock was running guns.  They were tipped off.  They didn't know there was going to be an assassination attempt on Salman by Al Waleed (Salmans brother) just down the strip.\nPaddock brought the guns as he usually did.  Instead of getting paid this time, he was killed.  He was victim one.  The guns were used to shoot at the country music venue.  That was to create chaos and distract from the real target over at the Tropicana.\n\nAl Waleed's assassins shot from Mandalay Bay, but they also were at the Tropicana trying to kill Salman.  That explains why there were shooters on the ground as well as in the air.\n\nRemember the videos of the helicopter fly over.  I asked why a helicopter would be there when there was a shooter high up.  It wasn't news, or cops.  It was the assassins who ran up the stairs to the roof from the 32nd floor.  Remember they sealed the door to the stairwell?  Paddock had access to the service elevator, because the boss said he could use the elevator, nobody questioned him.\n\nMeanwhile the assassination attempt on Salman failed.  Now we are seeing the result of the failed attempt.  It was not only an assassination attempt and a terror attack, but an attempted coup in Saudi.  This is why everyone shut up in Las Vegas.  The response is still ongoing.  You are watching it play out.  As I said I spoke on air about this.  I will post links in comments to prove my story.  Las Vegas was definitely a terror attack.\n\nPaddock was the gun runner.  Al Waleed, the owner of the suite was who is behind all of it.  All the witnesses citing multiple shooters all told the truth.  There were shootouts along the strip and in Mandalay Bay & Tropicana Hotels.  The reason nobody is talking is it's not over yet.\"",

Our culture has such a short attention span that simply saying \"this guy killed a bunch of people because he was mad about this thing we want you to feel bad for\" should be a nice simple way be to inspire a groundswell of whatever emotion is desired. This, though, seems like it went off without a clear reason why, which is what I find the most troubling.\n\nUnless, of course, the whole point was just to make people afraid of \"random acts of violence\", which of course would make people clamor for more gun regulation.",
      "Whatever the 'facts' of the shooting, as news stories reporting on a homicide investigation peter out, the media has been under-reporting how slipshod the investigation has been to the point of being deferential buttkissers instead of journalists...They suck so bad that the pattern of their slavish devotion to governmental scammers hit a new high/low with the security guard and his ~~handler~~ buddy with whom Ellen filled in for all journalists for all time with all-star softball skills...It's comical to say \"...dozens of unanswered questions remain.\"  Check out the triage video at (I didn't know they had a) Hooter's casino...Needless video suppression seems to be okay with most Americans, but not me...National security, anyone?",

Best example I can think of is Howard Stern. He had Chevy Chase & Donald Trump at his 2007 wedding. He had Trump on the show but they were never social.

She described her investigation of how the US ally Bahrain was committing human rights abuses, but said that CNN and the US government pressured her to suppress the news.

Lyon said that Kazakhstan and Georgia also paid for positive coverage by CNN.\n\n>In March 2013, a report from the state-run Syrian Arab News Agency said the \"Slovak main news website\" reported Lyon claiming to have received orders from CNN to report selectively and falsely in order to sway public opinion in favor of direct American aggression against Iran and Syria, and that this was common practice at CNN.",

The cleavage site structure’s job is to trick the human furin protein, so it will cut and activate the spike protein and cause a “direct fusion” of the viral and cellular membranes.\n\nThis makes it a LOT more infectious than the ACE2 receptor route, which I first thought, good day.\n\n\nThe 2015 Sars virus had the ACE2 transmission route, which is why it barely got anywhere. \n\nA good comment from a real scientist/group:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fcuxhz/were_science_educators_at_harvard_and_we_want_to/fjefpw8/?context=3\n\nI tend have provided lots of peer reviewed articles over the years, lmk what you want. \n\nScholar.google.ca is an easy search tool for those unaware.\n\nThe furin tricking cleavage site trick is a page out of the pneumonic flu playbook. TL;DR: Pneumonic flus do the same thing, this has been engineered to have a different transmission route than normal coronaviruses. \n\nNo way in hell this thing is natural, it would have likely have gained the virulence it needed to rip us apart to replicate its RNA if it was natural and would have been too lethal to get this far. In the link from the scientist:\n\n\"The polymerase of RNA viruses lacks the proofreading capacity found in the polymerase of DNA viruses, leading to high error rates and low replicative fidelity. **Although the high mutation rate of RNA viruses enables them to readily adapt to environmental changes, they also risk 'lethal mutagenesis' when accumulating mutations corrupt essential functions**. Here, Smith et al. reveal that, in the case of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), an exoribonuclease domain (ExoN) in non-structural protein 14 **provides proofreading activity that protects the virus from mutagenesis**.\" \n\nThis thing seems like its locked into place, it has gained an ability to directly fuse with cellular membranes by tricking the same machinery pneumonic flus use.\n\n\nHave a great day  c:\n\n\nEDIT: Not from me, Idk if they want credit, if they do I have no problem but here you go:\n\n\"Additionally, **it has been demonstrated that variation around the viral envelope glycoprotein cleavage site plays a role in cellular tropism and pathogenesis. For instance, the pathogenesis of some CoV has been previously related to the presence of a furin-like cleavage site in the S-protein sequence. For example, the insertion of a similar cleavage site in the infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) S-protein results in higher pathogenicity, pronounced neural symptoms and neurotropism in infected chickens** (Cheng et al., 2019).\"\n\n\nFrom my first linked peer reviewed article, after going to the DOI your lead here: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354220300528?via%3Dihub\n\n-**2019-nCoV S-protein sequence has a specific furin-like cleavage site absent in lineage b CoV including SARS-CoV sequences.**\n\n-**The furin-like cleavage site in the S-protein of 2019-nCoV may have implications for the viral life cycle and pathogenicity.**\n\n\n\nI love this, help guide me in the right direction people.\n\nEDIT: Anyone trying to say \"none of this is factual\" has no idea what they are talking about and have never reviewed a single peer reviewed paper on anything. Please don't listen to people who try to create more confusion. I offer up factual information that can be verified. I am referring to this comment:\n\n>Very little of this is actually factual. Most entry level microbioligy courses refute what you're saying. Stop mixing in all your supposition with the actual data please.\n\nFactual information being downgraded as \"supposition\", I honestly can't, people provide proper factual information and you guys downplay it, at this point its no wonder anything factual slips through the cracks when people try to project it as an \"uncertain belief\". These people aren't worth your energy.\n\nIf entry level microbiology can refute any of this, provide something besides conjecture.\n\nAlso, there is someone claiming to be a scientist in the comments, which is hilarious because they provide the current peer reviewed article being pushed by mainstream media that the virus isn't engineered, idc if its engineered or not. I want to know how to stop it and that's what I'm working towards.\n\n\nOnce again, don't listen to people who provide conjecture and can't actually explain anything, I provide a better explanation within a comment to someone, the \"scientist\" (he is versed in cell signalling, never said he had a verified degree, etc), has no idea what he's talking about, he provides conjecture and then a peer reviewed article that provides a conclusion, instead of discussion. \n\nSomeone who tries to tell you \"THIS IS HOW IT IS, EVERYONE ELSE IS WRONG\", who doesn't investigate the facts being presented to them logically, is a gatekeeper, and you should all be careful of that, this is a dangerous thread atm and this is my last edit, I will turn off inbox replies because I don't think anything good will come from seeing the stupid shit people try to spread.",

If this is useful I hope to expand the tool into a general citizen journalism platform for collecting evidence and investigating events ourselves, so we no longer need to rely on the MSM.\n\nThere's a feature I didn't mention before - if you pin videos that are nearby each other in time and space, you can click the little share button to the left of your pinned videos, and it generates a multi-view link. Soon this will also automatically sync the videos by time so you can see multiple angles of the exact same moment in time.\n\nedit 2: UPLOADING IS LIVE [www.vidi.world/upload](http://www.vidi.world/upload).\n\nedit 3: The Las Vegas Shooting and January 6th Happenings are temporarily removed from the front end as our servers were really lagging and spiking in price, with very few people investigating, so we are trying to fix that and will either host it on the same map again or on a new page. Hold tight - if you want a notification when it's back, join the discord or make an account on the site and you'll get an email when it's back.\n\nUPDATE: Starting Operation Missing Kids\n\nJoin r/operationmissingkids or contribute to the crowdsourced map of places+times a kid disappeared to help investigate.

The list is a very long one.  Murder is very common.  To this list I will add Huey Long, Presidents Lincoln, McKinley and Garfield.  If we were to also list those who survived murder attempts we would add Presidents Teddy Roosevelt and Ronald Reagan.  Then others such as Yitzhak Rabin, George Wallace, and many more.  It has been said that Murder is as American as Apple Pie and there is enough truth in this that no one should suspend their ability to accept the commonality of it.

Take it with a grain of salt.\n\nThe bill’s wording is unambiguous: providers, across the spectrum of devices and information services, **must design in the ability to decrypt data and provide it** in intelligible form. That applies to providers that have more than a million U.S. users. This **applies to both stored data (whether locally on a device, or remotely) and data in motion (i.e., communications in transit).** For providers of the former, they're covered if they've had a million or more users, or sold a million or more devices, in the U.S., annually, in 2016 or any year since. For providers of the latter, the threshold is one million monthly active users (MAUs) in the U.S., in January 2016 or any month thereafter. Providers will bear the costs of the proactive redesign; they will not be compensated by the government.\n\nhttps://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/blog/2020/06/there%E2%80%99s-now-even-worse-anti-encryption-bill-earn-it-doesn%E2%80%99t-make-earn-it-bill-ok\n\nhttps://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/06/senates-new-anti-encryption-bill-even-worse-earn-it-and-thats-saying-something",

Some say his experiment failed.\n\nMeet Dr. Jacobo Grinberg.\n\nHe was no ordinary scientist.\t\n- A psychologist and consciousness researcher\n- He explored telepathy and extraocular vision\n- He bridged ancient shamanic wisdom and quantum physics \n\nGrinberg proposed that reality is not what it seems. We don’t just observe the world. We create it.\n\nHe believed that our brains interact with an “informational matrix”—a hologram where perception and consciousness merge.\n\nHe even proved it:\nIn physics, the Lattice is the structure that underpins space-time.\n\nGrinberg gave this a new meaning.\nHe claimed that by tapping into this lattice through consciousness, we could change space-time itself.\n\nThat’s bending reality is not an illusion, but a conscious act.\n\nHis theory was called Syntergy—a blend of synthesis and energy.\n\nDr. Grinberg’s research discovered:\n- Our brains decode reality, forming a bridge with the lattice\n- Conscious thought can create changes in space-time\n- We’re participants, not spectators, in reality\n\nIf the brain’s “neuronal field” syncs with space’s energy field, consciousness could affect the fabric of existence.\n\nThink about that:\nYour mind, altering the blueprint of reality itself.\n\nThis theory challenges everything we know.\n\nGrinberg’s work mirrored the “implicate order theory” by physicist David Bohm.\nBohm described space as a “holographic sea of potentialities”—where the universe and consciousness unfold together.\n\nBut, Grinberg’s ideas could explain nonlocality: instant connections beyond space.\n\nHe didn’t just theorize.\nHe experimented.\n\nDr. Grinberg conducted telepathy tests, proving that two meditating brains could sync—showing identical brain patterns without physical connection.\n\nHe called this phenomenon Transferred Potential (TP).\n\nGrinberg’s fieldwork with Mexican shamans revealed astounding abilities.\nThey could “see” without eyes, heal with intention, and manipulate reality.\n\nHe believed these practices showed a highly neurosyntergic brain, capable of altering the hologram itself.\n\nImagine having a brain so synchronized, it warps reality.\n\nGrinberg’s studies hinted at a chilling conclusion:\nWe inhabit a Matrix.\n\nNot just metaphorically, but as an energetic construct shaped by collective thought.\n\nAnd mastering it meant… transcending it.\n\nDecember 8, 1994.\nDr. Jacobo Grinberg vanishes.\n\nNo signs of struggle. No evidence. Nothing.\n\nHis wife claimed innocence.\nInvestigators were left baffled.\n\nRumors flew:\n- CIA involvement\n- Rivalry abduction\n- A self-experiment gone wrong\n\nHis final paper contained this warning:\n“When you understand how The Lattice works you may simply… disappear.”\n\nIs this ascension?\nYe shall be as Gods on Earth.\n\nDo you see how powerful we all are? Do you now understand how much religion banning pretty much everything keeps us mentally in the dark ages?\n\nThere isn’t much more to this, but I believe Terrence Howard figured out the lattice of the flower of life, the oldest symbol on earth.\n\nAnd we still think the ancients were retarded.\n\nWake up everyone!",

      "Not trying to be apathetic here just curious.. My wife got cancer as well and went through 3-4 months of chemo, had surgery and another month or so of radiation and minor follow up procedures. I am in the U.S. as well and it cost us a total of $8k with insurance as that was her maximum out of pocket yearly expense. I was in a severe car accident and was in ICU for two weeks and hospitalized for another two and had therapy and further procedures through the following 8 months. My bill was also a maximum of $8k. Are we unique here? How are people with insurance paying hundreds of thousands for treatment? Don't you have out of pocket maximums? Genuine curiosity here.",
      "I think problems go both ways on healthcare - there's good and bad with both insurance based system and centrally funded like the NHS. \n\nIn the US, the whole health insurance led by private for profit companies means you will get insurers trying to wriggle out of every commitment they can. However, because hospitals charge insurers for the services provided, you are checked and treated more thoroughly as the more that the doctors/hospitals do, the more they can charge for.\n\nIn the UK, we have the centrally funded NHS service. As it is centrally funded, every private company who supplies services or products to the NHS absolutely rinse them for everything they have (for me it would work out cheaper to have health insurance than the amount of tax that I pay that is given to the NHS).\n\nMy nearest hospital was previously under contract with Carillion Plc (which went into liquidation a few years back). They would provide services such as cleaning, food and car parking services.\n\nCar parking charges meant a hospital visit would cost at least £5-6 minimum. \n\nThe NHS would employ cleaners who were then loaned out to Carillion to perform the cleaning contract for the NHS at a charge.\n\nIf additional lunches were needed to be provided they were at an extortionate cost. For example, a sandwich, pack of crisps, drink, piece of fruit and a chocolate bar (£4-5 worth of food) was provided by Carillion to the NHS for over £50.\n\nAs such with any centrally funded organisation, it is rife with mis management of funds and under staffing.\n\nAs a result, care can be hit and miss. \n\nMy step father was 'treated' with physio despite not getting any diagnostic scans done first. Doctor was adamant it was a trapped nerve. It turned out to be torn tendons in his shoulder which, after 6 months of physio and him complaining it was getting worse each week to the doctor, were actually torn fully. He then required surgery and a year out of work before he was well.\n\nA family friend also passed away after requiring a lung transplant. He was hospitalised whilst on the donor list and twice missed the emergency page for a suitable donor as the NHS failed to update internal systems to call the hospital instead of his house.",
      "Compared to Europe, in total the USA pays more (per head of population) for healthcare, for worse outcomes.\nThe advantage in Europe is that government agencies get involved, negotiate with the suppliers and providers, and get better deals.\nIf we also had universal health care in the US, our costs would go down.\nBut... and I speak as a Texas conservative... very difficult to educate on that. People whose minds are stuck in the current system think universal healthcare would be expensive. Even friends of mine where I can sit with them, show them the numbers, still have trouble changing such a fixed mindset.\nAs a famous pirate once said..\nThe problem is not the problem. The problem is the attitude to the problem.",

One minor exception came in a question about the sexual harassment that took place in his 2016 campaign. His response to the initial reports was too dismissive, and last night he wasn’t able to fully articulate how he would stop it from happening again, other than saying that his campaign is committing lots of resources and he will have the “strongest protocols” and utilize an “independent commission” that people can bring their complaints to, without really elaborating on who or what that commission would do.\n\n>The bigger problem here is that we find ourselves in a confusing situation thanks to cable news not adhering to basic standards of journalism. (Unfortunately, that’s an evergreen sentence.) When I watched the town hall live last night, this question seemed completely normal and well within the bounds of what Bernie was brought there to talk about, but now that it has been revealed that the question was asked by an intern at a major lobbying firm, you cannot help but wonder about the intent behind this, as well as CNN’s role in selecting this questioner while not disclosing her workplace.\n\n\nhttps://heavy.com/news/2019/02/questioners-bernie-sanders-cnn-town-hall-bios/\n\n>CNN was not completely transparent about the background of some of the people who questioned Bernie Sanders during his town hall on Monday night. **Although the brief descriptions shown on screen were accurate to a degree, they didn’t all represent the whole story for some of the questioners. Some of the people who asked Sanders questions had a background working with the Democratic party or lobbyists.** However, interestingly enough, some of the people who asked tough questions were actually Sanders supporters. One shared on social media that he really wanted Sanders to publicly address an important issue in the campaign.  Read on to learn more.\n\n>Beth (@FaerieWhings on Twitter), the Mike Grapes Fan Account (@respecteconomy), and others delved into the background of the people who questioned Sanders. Many viewers commented that the Town Hall questions were incredibly tough, a contrast to how some other town halls were handled. **However, his supporters also agreed that it’s good for Sanders to be asked the tougher questions and address these issues up front. But for some, the tone felt overly harsh at times.**",

When you bring a bunch of politically-involved people out and depict them as just regular “Maryland voters,” one cannot help but wonder about the motivations behind a decision to do less journalism than is required of the situation. CNN brought a de facto lobbyist on their air and didn’t disclose it. That’s bad.*\n\n*Being politically-involved doesn’t disqualify these folks from asking questions, and it doesn’t automatically make their motivations disingenuous. These people are still people just like you and me. Had CNN been more accurate in describing the questioners, I wouldn’t be writing this column. The only reason we have to doubt their motivations is because CNN hid crucial context that is easily found in the public record, therefore we cannot help but wonder why CNN left out such vital information (I reached out to CNN and asked them to shed light on why they left out this vital info and will update the piece if I hear back).*\n\n*Again, the questions themselves last night were almost entirely fine on the surface. Bernie should face tough questions like any other presidential candidate, but we should put all of our cards on the table when going through this stuff (which doubles as my central criticism of Bernie’s handling of the sexual harassment revelations). CNN bringing up these so-called “voters” to ask some of the most politically perilous questions for Bernie comes off as incredibly shady, and doubly so since they didn’t reveal their backgrounds. CNN was either pushing an agenda, or they failed at a very basic tenet of journalism. I don’t have enough information to come to a firm conclusion about CNN’s motivation, but if I assumed that these multiple oversights were intentional as part of a larger anti-Bernie agenda, there would be more journalistic rationale behind my assertion than CNN’s belief that they can get away with characterizing the current Chair of the Baltimore County Democratic Party as simply a “former biology professor.”*",

      "Let me tell you something from an attorney's point of view that I mean half serious and half sarcastic, cynic and ironic at once: if as a defendant you have to argue against a completely lost case that you do not want to accept under any circumstances, there's no chance but to hang onto *each and every* last straw you can find. Or in case you can't find any single one, each and every one you are able to make up.\n\n*And now, after* ***reading through the actual fucking reply*** *here's legalese translated without willingly misleading you all sheeple so you may circle jerk around it:*\n\nThe parents of the kid were plaintiffs individually and as parents as well as proceeding for their minor son as his parents and natural guardians as next friends. The 10th defense was that \n\n*To the extent as may be shown by the evidence through discovery, plaintiffs'injuries and damages, if any, were caused by the deliberate, criminal conduct of plaintiffs, and such criminal conduct supersedes any and all negligence or liability, if any, on the part of these defendants.*\n\nIt's possible to twist and turn this into \"the kid was criminally lying asleep in his crib\". But that is not what they claimed because context of such a statement is very, very defining in legalese: The defendants denied that anybody was asleep, even the infant, because they didn't know, which is their good right. They agreed that the child was in a playpen and the flash bang inadvertantly landed there. Two things: A playpen is not the same as a crib. We can argue heavily over where it's more likely to find a kid asleep and at which time of day - at 2 AM in the playpen or in an actual crib/cot/infant bed? The second is that they claimed to have taken all necessary measures to avoid harm, which is totally legitimate and their task to prove only if the actual harm as claimed by the plaintiff is proven. Lastly and much more important, the accusation of criminal conduct goes against the parents themselves as plaintiffs, not the child. It refers to the alleged drug crimes taking place in the house under their alleged connivance which the defendants alleged was putting the child at risk of the harm he suffered.\n\nAnd finally regarding other points in the Sheeple post, it is completely normal to counter all evidence with denial of accuracy if you do not and can not know certain things - the plaintiffs demand something from the defendants, so they'll have to prove the facts they base this on.\n\nI'm not here to judge if any of this is morally or ethically correct, this is just what happens in a civil legal case. You can still be outraged at the cops going through with it. But there's always two sides to such a case and we don't know for sure what happened because they settled.",

The officers need to assert certain affirmative defenses in their answer to the complaint, and the phrases the blogger objects to are just the requisite legal mumbo jumbo necessary to preserve those possible defenses (the validity of which will be adjudicated much much later). They have to assert ALL **possible** defenses at this point, which would include contributory criminal conduct on the part of \"plaintiffs\" (not the infant himself, but his parents etc.). \n\nTo the extent these defenses don't have any merit, and I certainly don't think they have any, they'll be done away with later.

Before, it was more likely to shut off unexpectedly when it was less than 20% or so. The slowing down change made the phone consume less power *only if the battery required it* and the percentage indicator would more reliably tick down to 1% before shutting off. It’s actually an improvement for everyone, especially those who keep phones past two years (when the battery is in its old age).\n\nPeople are conflating the slow down with that caused by the major annual iOS updates in fall, which may need more processing power or RAM to run at the same speed as the last OS.\n\nThe actual conspiracy part of this is Apple having a batch of bad batteries (I think it was the 6 or 6S. Maybe both. Not sure). They did this to make the bad batteries less noticeable.\n\nOne more thing: if you do Apple’s big fall new iOS update then continue doing updates until the following fall. Often, the giant new release that comes in fall has issues (including performance issues) that are improved in subsequent small updates later. If you’re going to not update your phones, change that to “I’m not going to update major OS versions in fall. Please give me the bug fixes for the version I already have”.",

They do not plan on doing anything except sticking to the status quo and then whispering in your ear that it's not their fault things haven't changed. It's the other side's fault. \n\nThey benefit when we're distracted by identity politics and war among ourselves. They want us too busy fighting with each other to pay attention to them. The more we let left/right or black/white divide us, the better off they are."

It’s really popular among older folks because it’s a consistent, never ending (in some cases) cash flow. In many cases, it’s a similar set up to how our social security system works. Essentially, you pay in to some sort of financing firm and then at a certain point you start receiving cash on a monthly basis. The value proposition of these financial packages is, for example, let’s say the buy-in for an annuity is 200k. You start receiving cash flows of 10k per month at age 60. It’s a worthwhile investment for you, a senior citizen, assuming you think you’ll last longer than your investment term period, which in this cases is 20 more years (technically its longer due to the time value of money but we won’t get into that). The social security system was meant to establish a reliable way for all people to have access to this sort of deal. It seems bad on paper, and it’s certainly not the best annuity program either,  but in reality it’s a highly popular and equitable solution for a lot of people."
