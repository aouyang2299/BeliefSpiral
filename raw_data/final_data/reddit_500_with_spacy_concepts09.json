      "FYI this is not actually how wealthy people avoid paying taxes. There are much simpler, less risky ways to get out of taxes for the wealthy. \n\nThe grain of truth here is that wealthy people do collect as patrons groups of artists who they then promote among their well connected circles with the hopes that one of the artists will become a big name. \n\nMany wealthy people view collecting art as a relatively stable way of investing as a hobby. The thinking, simplified, is that once you buy a painting, you have assigned that painting a value of whatever you paid for it. Worst case, you could re-sell it for about the same price later on, or simply enjoy the piece for what it is. But like housing, the expected trajectory is that as an artist becomes more famous via promotion from benefactors, the value of the  art will only go up. \n\nAnd largely, this seems to bear out to be true. Collecting art is at worst a break even sport for most wealthy people.",

If you paid an artist $25k for a painting and suddenly it was valued at 20 million, the IRS requires an explanation of the increase in value. And for donations of art over $50k, you need to pay the IRS a fee, and get an appraisal from a qualified appraiser that is approved by the IRS. Such an obvious fraud scheme would generate many flags for the IRS.",

      "Remember when everyone forgot what insider trading is? Look I'm not trying to say what these people did was right,*however* it was **not** insider trading.\n\nFor those of you, and there appears to be many of you, who dont know what insider trading is. In broad strokes. It is when you are privy to information **NOT** widely available to the public and trade based on that information. An example being. You learn from a friend who works at a major company that this major company is about to announce a merger with another major company that will undoubtedly raise share costs. Then you act on it by buying or selling shares.\n\nWhy is this not a case of this? Because simply put it was public information that there was a highly infectious disease spreading across the Asian world. Literally everyone knew this. These folks simply read the market, and where right. Now mind you while privately selling shares they where publicly saying everything was going to be fine. Isn't that more typical American politics though?\n\nHere are some questions to ask yourself about a situation in the future to narrow down if something is insider trading. Could anyone have acted this way? In this case yes. If you had stock you could have sold it off in fear of the virus hitting America. And could it have failed? Again in this case yes. It was possible I'll be it unlikely that the virus never made it to the US and or the market was not effected in a major way by it. \n\nThe only thing these people are guilty of is saying to the public that everything was fine while selling shares. The only way this could be insider trading on any level is if you can **PROVE** these people had access to information about the virus **AND** it's effects on the market before that information was made available to the public. \n\nIn closing, what they did was morally shit. It was a fucked up thing to do. However you and everyone else could have done the same thing. Its call wallstreet, this shit happens every day. \"Oh yeah Frank I think buying shares in that company is a great idea\" later that day \"Frank is an idiot, that idea is never going to pan out. I'm not buying any shares in that company\". Or in this situation. \"Don't worry about virus. Everything will be fine. Keep calm and carry on\" later that day. \"I don't believe that shit at all. I'm selling all my shares. I would rather be safe then sorry.\" I mean what do you suggest instead of this? They have gone on TV and said \"HOLY SHIT WE ARE ALL DOOMED THE MARKET IS DOOMED SELL ALL YOUR SHIT!\" They did what literally every politician has done since the literal beginning of politics.",

      "Not sure if the McCains were on the flight logs but Cindy McCain said:\n\n\"Epstein was hiding in plain sight,\" said Cindy McCain. \"We all knew about him. We all knew what he was doing, but we had no one that was — no legal aspect that would go after him. They were afraid of him. For whatever reason, they were afraid of him.\"\n\nhttps://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/cindy-mccain-admits-we-all-knew-about-epstein",
      "Not for nothing, but if their names are on the flight logs they are most definitely a part of an ongoing investigation and would not be able to discuss it to the public without some kind of legal backlash.\n\nKeep that in mind.",
      "Here's the thing: (I know nothing, I am not connected to anyone - this is pure conjecture based on what I, and everyone else, knows from media reports)\n\nI think Epstein was one of those “I can get you *anything* you want” kind of guys. Drugs? Sex grannies? Little people dressed up like cherubs feeding grapes to people in leather gimp suits? I bet he did it all, and he probably kept really good records in case he ever needed a favor later on. And I'm sure a subset of that included underage girls. But I also don't think it was *all underage girls, all the time*.\n\nThere were probably crazy drug-fueled sex parties at the island that nobody really wants to talk about, but that doesn't mean they are all pedophiles. Again, **I think some of them definitely were.** But if I'm a treasured national celebrity, and I put on a gorilla costume and jerked off while watching my wife blow a guy dressed up like a coal miner, I probably don't want that coming out. I'm probably going to keep my mouth shut, even though I've done nothing illegal.\n\nI believe that's why we're seeing so much silence from people involved. Everyone has kinks that they may or may not consider shameful, but I don't think everyone's kink violates the law. I believe, in fact, that was probably a relatively small minority of Epstein's clientele, so I don't think it's especially fair to tar and feather everyone, even if they went to parties on the island. \n\nI'm sure Clinton did some dirty stuff on that island. Probably Trump, too. But they both strike me as more of the “snorting cocaine off a Colombian hooker’s ass,” or “handcuff me to a bed and spank me with a magazine that features my face on the cover” type offenses. I’m a bit less optimistic about Prince Andrew and Les Wexner, and I'm sure there are others who broke those “half your age plus seven” rule. But that doesn't mean there are hundreds of pedophiles running around. Probably just hundreds of people with things to hide.\n\nFinally, Epstein **definitely** didn’t kill himself.",

      "**PRESS STATEMENT**\n\nCONCERNING THE DISHONESTY OF THE WYCKOFF POLICE\nIN REGARDS TO THE KILLING OF OUR DOG OTTO\n\n05/01/2015\n\nWe are issuing this statement as a means of collecting the evidence we’ve assembled relating to the killing of our pet German Shepard, Otto, on 04/29/2015. We’d like to make it clear that while it is devastating to have lost our beloved pet, and this tragedy was obviously completely avoidable, an excessive use of force, and a dangerously negligent act on the behalf of the Officer - we would have found satisfaction in an apology, and for the Wyckoff Police to have told the truth surrounding the circumstances that caused this disaster. Unfortunately, the Wyckoff Police have defended the actions of the officer, assumed no responsibility, conducted no official investigation, and have consistently contradicted the reports of the two eye-witness neighbors, as well as the physical evidence at the scene. Very clearly, they are not being truthful, nor accepting liability for an extreme act of negligence. \n\n**WHAT THE POLICE SAY**\n\nThough the Wyckoff Police Department has not yet released the official police report, we spoke to the police chief on the afternoon of 05/01/2015, and asked if he was sticking to the details that he made public through the media. He confidently confirmed that the details of the police report would be consistent with the statements he made to the media on 04/30/2015. \n\nWe are told that while dispatch issued a call to 621 Lawlins Rd., the officer verbally confirmed the incorrect address, stating “622” over the radio. He was not corrected. The police maintain that the officer then proceeded down the driveway to the front door of 622 Lawlins Rd., the Vukobratovic residence. He then supposedly knocked loudly, multiple times - finding no one home, he entered the back yard through the unlocked gate, and proceeded into the yard, around the landscaping, to a the patio area where he discovered an open window. According to the police, the officer considered the window a possible point of entry for what he believed to be a burglary in progress, and drew his weapon. It was at this time that Otto, “lunged” at the officer through the open window, attacking his boot. The officer maintains that the dog “had him” by the boot, and considered his life to be in danger, which was reason for him to fire four rounds at the dog - two of which missed, the other two hit Otto in his back and side.\n\nAfter the incident, Animal Control arrived to take Otto to the hospital. No investigation was made on the actual crime scene. The officers who arrived on the scene scoured the yard looking for the casings and bullets from the missed shots. No report was made regarding these ballistics, nor were any photographs taken of the scene. The Wyckoff Police department maintains that the use of force was completely justified, as the dog was violently attacking the Officer, putting his life at risk. Despite this, the officer sustained no injuries. The officer remains in active duty.\n\n**WHAT WITNESSES SAY**\n\nTwo adult residents and a child were home mid-afternoon on 04/29/2015. Having just had their windows professionally cleaned, the blinds in their home were open on every window. One of the residents was inspecting the work done on the windows and noticed some unusual damage to one of them, indicating a potential point of entry for what could be a future burglary incident. He called his cleaning service, and they denied causing the damage. Not wanting to create an emergency situation, especially with a child in the home, the resident drove to the Wyckoff Police Department to file an official report regarding the damage. He spoke to an officer at the front desk, and was told a patrolman would be dispatched to his home within the hour.\n\nA short time later, a patrol car pulled onto the street in front of 622 Lawlins Rd., and both residents of 621 Lawlins Rd. approached the front of the house - one at the window, one at the door. They observed the officer exit the vehicle and proceed down the driveway of 622 Lawlins Rd. There were no cars parked in the driveway of 622 Lawlins Rd., so the residents of 621 had an unobscured vantage point. Moments later, the officer was observed entering the backyard through the gate. Within seconds, one resident observed Otto coming around the corner of the house, barking at the officer. The officer was then observed taking a “standard shooting position” and firing multiple times at the dog. The resident observed dirt being kicked into the air from at least one of the shots being fired into the ground. Upon hearing gunshots, one resident left the house, yelling at the officer for being at the wrong address, questioning what he was doing. He raised his hands to his head as a gesture of disbelief regarding his own actions.\n\n**EVIDENCE**\n\nThe officer claims he entered the property, came around the side of the house, and observed an open window that he believed was a possible point of entry in relation to this “burglary” call. While inspecting the window, Otto lunged from the window, startling the officer, at which point he fired four times at the dog. This is easily disproven. The eyewitness statements are extremely clear about being able to observe the officer firing at the dog near the gate, nowhere near any open window he could have been alerted to. \n\nOn Thursday, 04/30/2015 Zana Vukobratovic discovered a bullet casing laying in plain sight on the grass near the gate to their backyard. Officers were called to investigate the casing, but made no photograph of its location, handled it without gloves, and did not thoroughly document the scene. \n\nOn Friday, 05/01/2015, while walking in the yard, Igor and Chris (his friend), discovered a bullet embedded in the dirt, approximately 18 feet from the entrance to the backyard. The location of this bullet is supported by the statement of the resident at 621 Lawlins Rd. that saw dirt kicked into the air from one of the shots. Realizing that there could very easily be additional evidence still at the scene, Igor and Chris combed the area, and discovered a bullet casing resting in the leaves, mere inches from the casing recovered on Thursday 04/30/2015.\n\nThe photo below demonstrates the likely position of the officer at the time of the shooting based on the location of these three pieces of ballistics:\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/iYVJOl9.jpg\n\nAs you can see from the below photograph, while standing in this position, the officer would have not had a view of the rear patio area where the open window was supposedly observed:\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/xre81Zv.jpg\n\nHere you can see how close the bullet in the dirt was found in relation to the entrance to the backyard. The officer very obviously opened fire within the first few feet of the backyard:\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/BKgHuB5.jpg\n\nBelow is the undisturbed bullet casing No. 2 that was found on Friday morning, 05/01/2015:\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/blcnBxa.jpg\n\n**MOVING FORWARD**\n\nAt the time of issuing this statement, we have not alerted the Wyckoff Police Department to the discovery of Casing No. 2, or the stray bullet. Quite frankly, we are concerned with their integrity, being that police chief does not seem interested in an official investigation. We have sought legal counsel in regards to charges that may be brought against the Wyckoff Police Department, and have determined that we will be pursuing them for damages, which in accordance to New Jersey law, is limited to the cost of Otto himself, and expenses related to this tragedy. Despite their extreme negligence, excessive use of force, discharging of a firearm in a residential neighborhood, and fabricated police report, the officer will only be held accountable by the department itself. If there is enough support from the community, we may be able to drive the point home that we do not tolerate this kind of irresponsibility on our local police force - nor do we tolerate the fabrication of details in order to protect a wildly negligent officer responsible for needlessly murdering a family pet in its own backyard. It is up to us to hold them accountable.\n\n--------\n\n**Support:**\n\n- Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/Justiceforotto\n\n- [Petition (has some typos, Igor didn't make this)](https://www.change.org/p/wyckoff-nj-police-department-fire-officer-kyle-ferreria-for-the-murder-of-otto-the-dog?recruiter=11862285&utm_source=share_petition&utm_medium=facebook&utm_campaign=autopublish&utm_term=mob-xs-share_petition-reason_msg&fb_ref=Default)\n",

Jeb Bush\n\n- Trump: ‘Disloyal’ Hillary threw Sanders under the bus\n\n- Ex-Obama adviser: DNC 'putting finger on scale' for Hillary\n\n- Hillary Clinton just slimed Bernie Sanders with a discredited Rupert Murdoch attack on single-payer health care\n\n- Is the Democratic Party Rigging the Election for Hillary Clinton?\n\n- Hillary Clinton will need to face facts: Her husband allowed Wall Street to run wild. Bill Clinton oversaw the repeal of Glass-Steagall, which played a key role in the 2008 fiasco.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/politics/search?q=hillary&sort=top&restrict_sr=on&t=week\n\n(FWIW - I'm a Bernie supporter... I am just capable of observing things in plain sight.)",

      "Not just the Clinton campaign. All the companies are on here. \n\nGo to /r/space and look at the SpaceX stories - there is small militia of the same 10 - 15 user accounts who always comment about how great the company is, and down vote anyone who says anything negative about Musk.\n\nIn /r/politics there are the same small group of people who are always adding Sanders stories.\n\nin /r/cars there are obviously some Ford/Chevy employees n the comments section. \n\nIt's all over the place. ",
      "It goes against the liberal reddit narrative: Republicans = far right fascist nazi haters, Democrats = moderate, thoughtful, reasonable heroes.\n\nGo against that narrative and you'll get downvoted to oblivion in most default subs.",
      "Correlation isn't the same of causation, unless it's things I dislike. Then it's a conspiracy.",
      "Yeah, pretty much every time I post anything critical to Clinton or Sanders, it is instantly voted down or removed by the mods.",

      "Anti-Hillary stuff gets upvoted to the top of /r/all all of the time thanks the the very active Sanders supporters on Reddit. \n\nAlso, I came here from /r/all so the pro-Hillary bots must have missed this one if they actually existed.",
      "> \"The numbers, collected by the Federal Election Commission and compiled by Open Secrets, also reveal that Rand Paul and Bernie Sanders make the list of top 20 senators and top six presidential candidates to receive money from arms and defense companies.\"\n\nThis was kind of more confusing to me at first, but I guess I can see it.",
      "Quite literally the dumbest thing i've ever heard. Reddit is the biggest pro bernie circlejerk in existence, yet no one bats an eye",

      "You know, it's almost as if the good people in Hollywood are trying to get out in front of this shit storm that is approaching.. The actual good people that can't be blackmailed seem to be letting people know ahead of time that they're not a part of \"them\"..",
      "Before it gets spammed in here, someone created a \"CrewsCrew\" subreddit to supposedly support Terry. After Terry himself posted there thanking Reddit for the support the mods made social media accounts for the sub and started selling tshirts and other goods. THIS MONEY GOES TO THE MODS NOT TO HELP TERRY. Be aware that people are using the fact that reddit is so supportive of Terry to scam people out of money.\n\nhttps://np.reddit.com/r/TheseFuckingAccounts/comments/7hqmwe/keep_an_eye_on_rcrewscrew/\n\n\nEDIT: /u/Imreallynotatoaster has PMd me and [replied](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7k8v1o/terry_crews_if_i_have_a_timely_accident_you_know/drga91o/) in here and asked me to edit my comment and state that the subreddit is not scamming money and asked me to put up [this link](https://www.reddit.com/r/CrewsCrew/comments/7kf1x5/rainn_donation_verification_post/) as proof. This account was purpose made for moderating subreddits related to Terry Crews as soon as the story broke and the post of \"proof\" is filled with people still calling it out. So make your own conclusions. If you do want to do something for charity I urge you to donate directly to a charity rather than trusting brand new mod accounts on reddit with your money. You have to wonder why they so badly want you to donate through them rather than directly to a charity and why they make throwaway mod accounts for it rather than accounts with an established and trusted history.",
