    "title": "Musk echoes rightwing conspiracy theories to defend social security cuts",
    "content": "Elon Musk is claiming, without evidence, that Democrats have been using fraud in entitlements like social security and Medicare to attract immigrants and boost their voting ranks – language that also echoes racist rightwing conspiracy theories. The billionaire owner of Tesla and SpaceX and Donald Trump’s “first buddy” has been trying to justify cuts to programs like social security, arguing that the fraud has cost the government up to $200bn. “This is why the Democrats are so upset about the situation,” Musk said on a podcast with the Republican senator Ted Cruz and radio host Ben Ferguson.\n\n“By using entitlements fraud, the Democrats have been able to attract and retain vast numbers of illegal immigrants and buy voters. Basically bring in 10, 20 million people who are beholden to the Democrats for government handouts and will vote overwhelmingly Democrat.” Musk said that his so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge) will “turn off fraudulent payments of entitlements” to “illegals”, as he listed off a long slate of government programs including social security, Medicare, unemployment, disability and small business loans. He then voiced what sounded akin to the “great replacement theory”, which has been taken on by rightwing extremists and describes the theory that people in the US, specifically those who are white, are being “replaced” by immigrants. “If the Dems can bring in 200,000 illegals and get them legalized … even without cheating, if you bring in illegals that are 10 [times] the voting differential in a swing state, it will no longer be a swing state,” Musk said. “And the Dems will win all the swing states in a matter of time.” Musk then warned of the “deep socialist state” that Democrats will achieve if they take over the federal government. “They will further cement that by bringing in more aliens, so you can’t vote your way out of it,” he said. Over the last few days, Musk’s Doge has started to zero in on social security – what Musk has called “the biggest Ponzi scheme of all time” – arguing that the agency has seen billions of dollars in fraud, though not necessarily from immigrants. Musk has especially attached himself to an alleged list of dead people he says the agency is still giving money to. In a recent interview with Fox Business, Musk claimed that there were 20 million “dead people in the social security database”. At least 10 employees with Doge have been specifically tasked with trying to find people in the US who are dead but still receive social security payments. Those with the agency, including the acting commissioner, Lee Dudek, have said the list Musk is referring to are people who don’t have date of deaths on their records and are not necessarily receiving benefits. Musk has also made some other changes at the Social Security Administration (SSA), the agency that oversees social security. Like many other federal agencies, SSA is seeing cuts to its workforce. In February, the agency said that it was reducing its staffing target to 50,000, down from 57,000. Under pressure from Musk, the SSA said that it will start requiring in-person identity checks for recipients. In the past, recipients who couldn’t verify their identity online could do so over the phone. Different government agencies have released competing figures of how much the government has lost to fraud. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) reported last April that estimated fraud could be between $233bn to $521bn, though it notes that it accounts for pandemic-specific payments that could have led to a “higher-risk environment” for fraud. The report that the White House’s office of management and budget had found lower estimates of fraud, between $4.4bn and $7.31bn during the same time period. When it comes to social security, the agency records improper payments and has said that 0.3% of all payments have been inaccurate, largely due to mistakes or delays.",

    "title": "Trump pick to head CDC sparks Maga backlash among conspiracy theorists",
    "content": "Donald Trump’s appointment of a career health researcher to head the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has provoked a serious rightwing backlash for the new administration. Dozens of Maga influencers, along with many rank-and-file Trump supporters, have taken to social media to denounce Susan Monarez to spin false conspiracy theories about her connections to the CIA and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (Darpa). On X, Truth Social, across rightwing “alt-tech” sites and in segments of rightwing media, there was a vociferous response to the announcement this week that Monarez would continue in the position she has been acting in at the CDC, following the withdrawal of Trump’s initial nominee, David Weldon, who unlike Monarez has a history of supporting fringe theories which oppose vaccination. The firestorm among the conspiracy theorists and science deniers of the anti-vaccine set shows the power of that constituency among Trump’s circle as it quickly forced Trump’s Health and Human Services (HHS) secretary, Robert F Kennedy, to defend the hire in a post on X. Kennedy wrote: “X posts that erroneously attribute Biden-era tweets supporting masks, lockdowns, vaccine mandates, etc. to my @CDCgov Director nominee, Susan Monarez, have understandably provoked agita within the MAHA [Make America Healthy Again] movement.” He continued, “I handpicked Susan for this job because she is a longtime champion of MAHA values, and a caring, compassionate and brilliant microbiologist and a tech wizard who will reorient CDC toward public health and gold-standard science.” The opposition to Monarez – an immunologist with decades of government service – has so far been couched entirely in terms of the anti-vaccine beliefs that have consumed a segment of Trump’s base in the years since the Covid-19 pandemic. Kennedy himself is also well known for holding fringe beliefs around vaccines and other health matters and has called his agenda Make America Healthy Again (Maha). On Monday John Sabal, who on social media goes by the Patriot Voice, told his 150,000 X followers that Monarez was “a DARPA stooge” and “quite literally the OPPOSITE of the MAHA agenda”. Sabal – a sometime guest of far-right media personality Alex Jones – folded Monarez’s appointment into a conspiracy narrative which encompassed Elon Musk’s Starlink, mRNA vaccines and the Trump-backed “Project Stargate” AI initiative. He concluded: “We are heading towards AI Governance Technocracy at WARP SPEED.” Like hundreds of other critics on X, Sabal had conflated the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health (ARPA-H), a HHS agency created in 2022 where Monarez was previously deputy director, with Darpa, an agency of the Department of Defense. On Tuesday, Margo Montez-Lind, who posts on X to over half a million followers as “@ProudArmyBrat”, posted about Monarez: “She worked for Biden & Obama. She supports all of Fauci’s policies, and is a huge proponent of Big Pharma. She pushes the dangerous Mrna covid jab for babies. Loves boosters. Loves masks. This is an absolute nightmare!”\n\nMany other posters interpreted the appointment as a sign of the Trump administration’s hostility to anti-vaxxers, and even as evidence of a broader conspiracy in which Kennedy himself may be a mere pawn. “Trump picked RFK to keep MAHA people quiet,” wrote one. “He had no intention of stopping anything.” The revolt was also visible on Trump’s own Truth Social platform. Users responding to Trump’s announcement of the nomination connected Monarez to the “chemtrails” conspiracy theory and railed against Monarez’s expressions of support for research funded by Bill Gates’s philanthropic foundation. The X posters haranguing Kennedy were amplified across a galaxy of anti-vax outlets, many of them on the newsletter platform Substack. The outrage soon spread to rightwing media. Grant Stinchfield of Real America’s Voice headlined the nomination as a “Maha Betrayal”. Former Infowars broadcaster David Knight said that Monarez was “same as old boss but now with AI genetic injection”. The appointment may indeed reflect Trump’s own historic inconsistencies on vaccines. Over time, Trump has alternated between welcoming the support, donations and votes of anti-vaxxers, and claiming credit for the mRNA vaccines developed in response to the Covid-19 epidemic under the auspices of Operation Warp Speed during his first administration. The Guardian contacted Monarez and the CDC but received no response. Weeks before Monarez’s nomination, the CDC announced plans to study any links between vaccines and autism. The belief that such a link exists is a core commitment for many anti-vaxxers, even though it is founded on discredited pseudoscience and conspiracy theories. Monarez’s nomination comes as Trump and billionaire tech mogul Elon Musk’s assault on federal agencies roils the CDC. The day after Trump’s announcement, five senior officials reportedly left the agency, including the heads of the agency’s Office of Science, the Public Health Infrastructure Center, and the National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities. Also out: CDC communications director Kevin Griffis. Kennedy’s attempts to defend Monarez had little impact with outraged Maha figures. Stella Immanuel, a Cameroonian American physician and pastor who came to prominence during the Covid-19 pandemic as an advocate for treating coronavirus with hydroxychloroquine, which has been repeatedly proved to be ineffective, posted in response: “That’s all great Secretary, but it’s time to ban mRNA injections! It’s time to prosecute Anthony Fauci. It’s time to remove vaccine mandates from our schools.”",

The fourth version of Adani Mining’s claim against environmental activist Ben Pennings – which has been afoot for more than four years – now names Kokoda veteran and climate activist Bill Ryan as an alleged co-conspirator. Ryan died in 2019, aged 97.\n\n“Why the hell can’t Adani leave Dad to rest in peace rather than drag us through this bullshit?” Ryan’s son, Colin, told Guardian Australia. The Queensland supreme court struck out substantial parts of Adani’s claim last year, describing some elements as “confused and embarrassing”. Adani’s allegations of a conspiracy – which accused Pennings of acting with “unknown conspirators” to disrupt the company’s contractors – were disallowed by Justice Susan Brown, who gave Adani leave to re-plead its case. Sign up for the Afternoon Update: Election 2025 email newsletter In its new filing – the fourth version of Adani’s statement of claim since launching the case in 2020 – the company has now named four alleged co-conspirators it says were involved in an agreement with Pennings to take part in direct protest action against contractor Downer Group in 2017. Mike Fitzsimon (referred to in Adani’s claim as “Mike Fitzsimmons”), a Vietnam veteran who died in 2022, is listed as a co-conspirator alongside Pennings and Ryan. The other alleged co-conspirators named by Adani are elderly Vietnam veteran Maurice Tolley and “Donna Smits”, whose name also appears to be misspelled in the document. They were named in court documents, but only Pennings is being sued by Adani. “Dad had a tough life, served his country in war and tried to protect us all [with his climate activism],” Colin Ryan said. “He died a hero to thousands but now I have to tell the grandkids and great-grandkids he’s part of some Adani conspiracy theory in the supreme court.”",

    "content": "We live in a blizzard of fake news, disinformation and conspiracy theories. It’s tempting to blame this on social media – which does indeed exacerbate the problem. And AI deepfakes promise to make the situation even worse. But at root this is not about technology: it’s about how humans think, as an astonishing case that long predates the internet reveals. This is an amazing story – about the perils of amazing stories. In November 1967, at the height of the war in Vietnam, a strange document was published in New York. Report from Iron Mountain was the work of a top-secret “special study group” recruited by the Kennedy administration to scope out what would happen to the US if permanent global peace broke out. It warned the end of war, and of the fear of war, would wreck America’s economy, even its whole society. To replace the effects, extreme measures would be required – eugenics, fake alien scares, pollution, blood games. Even slavery. The report was so incendiary it had been suppressed, but one of the study group leaked it, determined that the public learn the truth. It caused a furore. The worried memos, demanding someone check if this document was real, went all the way up to President Johnson.\n\nIn reality, as the White House eventually realised, Report from Iron Mountain was a hoax. It was the brainchild of leftwing satirists: Victor Navasky, editor of a magazine called Monocle, his colleagues, and a fellow satirist, Leonard Lewin, who wrote it with the help of luminaries like the famous economist and former US ambassador to India, JK Galbraith. Their goal was to expose what they saw as the insanity driving the intervention in Vietnam, and the whole of the cold war. By presenting their fake report as a real leak, they aimed to make people ask if this insane document might be real – and what that said about the people running the US government. And it worked. To young Americans living under the shadow of conscription, Report seemed all too plausible. Officials whispered to journalists that some of their colleagues really did think like this. Once the hoax had its satirical impact, Lewin came clean. But his work was so convincing it began to take on a life of its own.",

    "content": "The gunman involved in the 2016 “Pizzagate” conspiracy theory attack on a Washington DC pizza restaurant that was inaccurately thought to be at the center of a pedophile ring has died after being shot by police in North Carolina during a traffic stop. In a news release issued on Thursday, North Carolina’s Kannapolis police department announced that Edgar Maddison Welch died from his wounds caused by two police officers who fired at him after he pulled out a handgun during a traffic stop on Saturday. In 2016, Welch made headlines when he drove from his North Carolina home and stormed into the Washington DC-based Comet Ping Pong restaurant, where he fired an assault rifle inside. Although no injuries were reported, two weapons were found inside the restaurant and another one was recovered from Welch’s vehicle, police said at the time. According to police, Welch had come to the restaurant to “self-investigate” “Pizzagate”, a baseless conspiracy theory that falsely claimed that Hillary Clinton and her campaign chief John Podesta were operating an underground child sex-trafficking ring from the restaurant’s backrooms. In 2017, Welch pleaded guilty to assault with a dangerous weapon and interstate transport of a firearm. In a later interview with the New York Times, Welch expressed regret towards his actions, saying: “I just wanted to do some good and went about it the wrong way … I regret how I handled the situation.” According to the police news release, at around 10pm last Saturday, a Kannapolis police officer was patrolling North Cannon Boulevard and when he noticed a gray 2001 GMC Yukon car. “The officer recognized the vehicle as one normally driven by an individual who he had previously arrested, and knew had an outstanding warrant for arrest,” the release said, adding that the arrest warrant was for a felony probation violation. It went on to add that the officer stopped the car and during his interaction with the driver, the officer recognized the front seat passenger as the person with the outstanding arrest warrant.\n\n“While the officer was speaking with the driver, two additional Kannapolis officers arrived at the traffic stop to assist. The officer who initiated the traffic stop approached the passenger side of the vehicle and opened the front passenger’s door to arrest the individual,” the news release said. As the officer opened the car door, Welch pulled a handgun from his jacket and pointed it at him, police said. According to the news release, the officer and a second officer who was standing at the rear side of the car ordered Welch to drop the weapon. However, after Welch “failed to comply with their repeated requests, both officers fired their duty weapon at the passenger, striking him”. Welch was transported to the hospital but died from his wounds two days later. The officers who fired their guns have been identified as Brooks Jones and Caleb Tate in the news release. The investigation remains under way by the state’s bureau of investigation and Jones and Tate have been placed on administrative leave.",

    "title": "Conspiracy-laden, fire-prone icons: what will happen to LA’s palm trees?",
    "content": "When the Los Angeles wildfires broke out on the morning of 7 January, some of the most dramatic images were of palm trees set ablaze along Sunset Boulevard. In the days that followed, burning palms became a symbol to illustrate what may be the costliest wildfires in history, which left at least 25 dead and destroyed thousands of structures. The trees are icons of the city. They also played a role in spreading the flames, researchers and fire officials say. While a deadly combination of factors caused the fires, many palm species are fire-prone and difficult to extinguish once ignited. Poorly maintained palms, which have dead, dry material under their canopies, are notorious for being receptive to embers, the primary cause of structure loss in wildfires. In high winds, small chunks of burning fibers or large fiery fronds can travel long distances.\n\n“One Mexican fan palm frond is equivalent to a whole branch getting caught in the wind and moving, and when that gets caught on a roof, under an eave or any other flammable material, that’s much more significant than a pine needle or a sycamore leaf,” said Esther Margulies, a landscape architect and University of Southern California (USC) professor who specializes in climate and wildfire resilience planning. “Unfortunately, it makes logical sense” that they helped spread the fires. Research has shown that southern California’s palms – which are all non-native, except for the California fan palm that grows in the desert – “go up like Roman candles” when embers hit dead fronds. Palm trees have also ignited because of lightning strikes, power lines, fireworks and arson. The Los Angeles fire department says palms should not be used in known fire hazard severity zones. But not all palms are created equal. One that is intensively maintained and healthy may not catch fire like a palm in its natural conditions, where it has a big skirt of fronds hanging down. That has fueled wild conspiracy theories. Although thousands of palm trees have probably caught fire this month, some images of unscathed palms located next to destroyed homes stoked false claims about the fires being intentionally set by the government to initiate a “land grab” or to stop the development of China-funded, high-speed rail. The real reasons why some palms didn’t burn are varied. The way they were pruned, how much moisture the tree had internally and the unpredictability of wind patterns all affect flammability. If the tree was stressed, or leaking resins from a previous wound, that could play a role, too. Generally, healthy trees are less likely to ignite. The future of LA’s palms Meanwhile, the fires are shining light on another palm tree problem. It’s hard to imagine Los Angeles without its celebrated palm trees, but that could become a reality as they are under threat from fires, disease, pests, ageing and the fact that they are wildly impractical in a sprawling city that desperately needs more cooling benefits than palms can provide. They are also dangerous even when the city is fire-free. Residents have reported heavy fronds with thorny spines falling from 80-plus-foot heights, breaking roof tiles, piercing car windows and narrowly missing people in the process. Many palms were first planted in the Los Angeles area in the 18th century by Spanish missionaries who used the fronds in religious services. By the early 1900s, they were used as decorative plants by the wealthy and real estate developers, who marketed the city as a tropical paradise. The 25,000 trees planted in advance of the 1932 Los Angeles Olympics and the additional 40,000 that were added as part of the New Deal’s Works Progress Administration are now considered “senior citizens”. Tree experts say it’s never a good idea to plant so many of the same species simultaneously because of pests, disease and the fact that they will age out at the same time. A 1990 city tally estimated that there were 75,000 palm trees on city streets, but it’s unknown exactly how many are left standing, especially after the latest wildfires. A USC study of an urban area near downtown Los Angeles found that 12% of the street tree canopy consisted of highly flammable palms, Margulies said. Palms are more like grasses than trees, and they have been called out by environmentalists for their high water usage, inability to store large amounts of carbon dioxide and lack of shade. The Canary Island date palm, seen throughout the Beverly Hills and Hancock Park neighborhoods, is the one palm that can create a valuable shade canopy, but because of the trees’ potential dangers and high cost – a mature one can cost upwards of $20,000, which is why some have been stolen in the past – they are unsustainable. No one knows exactly when the palms will die, but when they do, some streets will have zero shade. The city or county of LA, which already has limited resources for maintaining its urban forest, will need to remove a significant volume of 100ft tall palm trees to be processed, disposed of or upcycled. “I am sympathetic to the aesthetic history of LA and I’m not of the mind that we should eradicate palms from the entirety of our landscape, but we should be more selective where they’re used,” said Bryan Vejar, master arborist and associate director of community forestry at TreePeople, an environmental non-profit. “They shouldn’t be used on streets where we need to mitigate some of the heat island effects.” People have strong opinions about the compositions of urban forests, with some believing LA should only plant native trees. Others say to only plant trees from the world’s hottest and driest places. Vejar believes we can do both and advocates for replacing the majority of the city’s palms with native oaks, desert willows and toyon, as well as extremely drought-tolerant non-natives such as the Chinese pistashe. Of course that would change the look and iconography of the city, but perhaps that’s the point: LA, advocates argue, should look more natural with a canopy that provides more benefits to all Angelenos. It’s unlikely that palms will disappear entirely. Homeowners and developers will probably continue to plant them on private property, despite the threats to and from them. The city has committed to maintaining palm trees in areas with historical significance such as Hollywood and parts of downtown, but otherwise is focused on planting climate-resilient species and creating an equitable urban forest. “Most palm trees have never been a good solution,” said Margulies. “We need to change the perception of LA. When it comes to living things, we really should have a deep respect for the trees that are native and indigenous to this area and really will thrive here.”",

    "title": "Conspiracy theory on methane-cutting cow feed a ‘wake-up call’, say scientists",
    "content": "Scientists say a recent methane-related conspiracy theory was “a wake-up call” for the industry, reminding them they need to communicate better and more directly with the public. Over the last few months, Bovaer, a cattle feed additive that is proven to reduce emissions of the greenhouse gas, has been at the centre of a swirl of misinformation, drawing in Reform UK, the dairy industry and even the billionaire Bill Gates. The conspiracy kicked off when Arla, the multinational food group best known for Lurpak butter, announced in November it would be running a pilot of Bovaer to reduce the carbon footprint of its products. Bovaer is the name given to 3-nitrooxypropanol, or “3-NOP”, one of a range of additives that are given to cattle to aid digestion and reduce their flatulence, which is a significant cause of methane emissions. Cutting methane, a gas many times more powerful than carbon dioxide at trapping heat in the atmosphere, would give the world breathing space in the fight to control temperature rises, many scientists have said. The Food Standards Agency (FSA) has been assessing the use of 3-NOP and says the additive has undergone rigorous testing over 10 years. According to Bovaer’s manufacturer, DSM-Firmenich, the additive is now approved in 68 countries and given to more than 200,000 cows. But what should have been an exciting announcement of a pioneering scheme to help reduce our greenhouse gas emissions quickly became a social media storm about the health effects of the additive, with people videoing themselves throwing away products by the brand and pouring milk down their sinks in protest. On 2 December, the Reform MP Rupert Lowe stated on X that he “won’t be consuming anything containing Bovaer”, and had requested that the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs undertook “an urgent review of its use in our food system”. Some posters had been linking to a report by the FSA published in 2023 that found 3-NOP “should be considered corrosive to the eyes, a skin irritant, and potentially harmful by inhalation” to humans handling it. The agency eventually had to release further guidance on the safety of using Bovaer, stating that the additive breaks down in the digestive tract and is therefore not present in milk produced by the cows ingesting it, so would not pose any risk for human consumption. The guidance above would only apply to handling 3-NOP in its pure form at the manufacturing stage. Other concerned social media users pointed to claims that 3-NOP could cause cancer. However, the results of a UK government assessment had concluded: “The additive is not carcinogenic at the recommended inclusion rate.” Somehow Bill Gates got dragged in too, with one variant of the conspiracy arguing that he was using his wealth to invest in population control – referring again to the concerns that if handled in its pure form, 3-NOP could cause male infertility. While the Microsoft co-founder has no connection to Bovaer, or its manufacturer, he has invested in a rival startup called Rumin8, which develops a similar methane-reducing product using seaweed to break down the gas. Arla released a statement dismissing any involvement from Gates in the trials, and DSM-Firmenich, a Swiss-Dutch company that develops products for the health, beauty, and nutrition industries, said it had “fully developed” Bovaer and that the company had “no other investors”. The FSA website said: “The FSA safety assessment concluded there are no safety concerns when Bovaer is used at the approved dose. “More than 58 studies on potential risks were evaluated and it was concluded that the additive is safe at twice the recommended dose. The additive is metabolised by the cows so does not pass into the milk. It was not found in milk in any of the trials presented to the FSA.” Answering questions at a press briefing on Monday about the scale of the misinformation, Dr Sinéad Waters, a senior researcher in host microbiome interactions at the University of Galway, said, “It’s a good wake-up call to scientists because really communication is with the farmers. “We want to bring everyone along with us on the journey. Communication is key, we need to do more of that, not just with the farmers but with the general public.” Also speaking at the briefing at the Science Media Centre was Prof Robin May, the chief scientific adviser at the FSA. He said: “The overwhelming response we saw from the public was confusion rather than jumping on board. The more communication and transparency the better.”",

    "title": "Salad chain Sweetgreen is caving to conspiracy theories about seed oils. Why?",
    "content": "It’s January, season of resolutions and virtue, when Americans collectively decide to throw out the butter and sugar and booze and embrace grain bowls and bone broth. Most of these resolutions – 80%, according to some studies – will fade by February, Super Bowl Sunday at the latest, so advertisers pushing dietary health trends have to strike fast. Earlier this month, for example, the salad chain Sweetgreen unveiled a new January menu that is completely free of “seed oils”. “Our country is having a long-overdue conversation about food,” Jonathan Neman, Sweetgreen’s co-founder and CEO, announced in a post on X. “And it’s about time. From ultra-processed ingredients to artificial additives, there’s a lot on our plates that isn’t doing us any favors.” Neman is wrong. Our country is always having a conversation about food. In particular, which food that we’ve always eaten has suddenly become “bad” for us. The latest culprits are seed oils, liquid fats extracted from vegetables that are used in cooking. The anti-seed-oil conversation began seven or eight years ago in the corners of the internet where legitimate concerns about diet and nutrition mix with dubious health claims. Eater has traced it to 2017, when an ophthalmologist named Chris Knobbe published a paper arguing that vegetable oils, along with white flour and sugar, are the primary cause of macular degeneration, a chronic and incurable eye disease that’s the leading cause of blindness in the US. Knobbe subsequently went further and concluded that these foods contributed to all “diseases of civilization”, including type 2 diabetes, obesity, heart disease, cancer and stroke, and recommended a return to “ancestral foods”, primarily meat and fish. Gradually, the conversation was taken up by “heterodox” influencers who like to say they’re “just asking questions” about government policies such as mandatory vaccines. In 2020, the podcaster Joe Rogan chatted for three hours with Paul Saladino, a physician and proponent of the carnivore diet, who told Rogan and his approximately 15 million listeners that “there’s a direct correlation between incorporating these processed seed oils and terrible health results”. Rogan quickly took up the cause himself. “Your body doesn’t know what the fuck to do with canola oil,” he declared. “Not only is it terrible for you, there’s evidence that it makes you hungrier.” Rogan has switched to animal fats, such as bacon and beef tallow, which he claims are more “natural”. Another physician, Cate Shanahan, collectively dubbed canola, corn, cottonseed, soybean, sunflower, safflower, grapeseed and rice bran oils the “Hateful Eight”.\n\nEnter Sweetgreen, the largest salad chain in the US, which could have chosen to emphasize that they were switching to avocado and extra virgin olive oil in their new menu (and 10 years ago they might have – when those oils’ health benefits were being regularly touted). But by focusing on having “no seed oils” in the marketing, they’re giving red meat (or beef tallow) to the likes of Rogan and Saladino. It didn’t matter that the FDA, the American Heart Association and most other medical associations had said that seed oils were not only OK, but healthier than solid animal fats, which have been proven to lead to high cholesterol, insulin resistance and inflammation. “Influencers have become incredibly powerful,” says Matt Jordan, a professor and critical media scholar at Penn State. “ They’ve displaced institutional expertise that people used to rely on.” This past fall, the anti-seed-oil crusade became politicized when it was taken up by Robert F Kennedy Jr, the former presidential candidate turned health secretary pick in the Trump administration. Kennedy told his social media followers that Americans had been “unknowingly poisoned by heavily subsidized seed oils” and he has promised to ban them if he takes office. (The incoming vice-president, JD Vance, has said he doesn’t cook with seed oils, either.)",

    "title": "How Covid left a legacy of distrust and conspiracies | Letters",
    "content": "The very title of Laura Spinney’s piece is a sad reflection of how pandemic control preferences quickly aligned along traditional political lines, to everybody’s detriment (Five years on from the pandemic, the right’s fake Covid narrative has been turbocharged into the mainstream, 9 March). If the right has been guilty of undermining science and scientists, I also observed through the pandemic how the left displayed a disturbing enthusiasm to restrict liberty, using fear and guilt to encourage compliance with control measures, and many arguing to prolong the restrictions beyond the point where they were doing any good. I have experience of how the Covid control measures in the NHS, while well-intentioned, were only dismantled at a snail’s pace after the greatest danger had passed, prolonging the disruptive effect of the pandemic on the nation’s health. School closures and enforced isolation have contributed hugely to the mental health problems and social isolation faced by all, but especially the young. While the vaccines were an impressive achievement and saved many lives, in the NHS we witnessed a foolish and time-consuming attempt to coerce all staff into being vaccinated. This was abandoned at the 11th hour, but some staff had already left rather than have a vaccine they distrusted. The general overreach of the state in the pandemic has sadly led many to be less trustful of official health guidance, especially regarding vaccines. Rather than put the blame on political opponents, with accusations of fake narratives, all of society needs to undergo some honest self-reflection and try to understand the views of those who disagree with us. Dr Aodhan Breathnach Consultant medical microbiologist (and former infection control doctor), St George’s Hospital, London • I agree with Laura Spinney that we need to do something about the negative narrative that has developed on the pandemic. Any rational person who reads the empirical evidence would surely agree that containment in the first instance, and the magic bullet of vaccination, saved us from many more deaths in the UK, even if as Spinney says, mistakes were made. I’m not sure how we go about silencing conspiracy theories on the pandemic and on vaccines in particular. Who reads the empirical evidence apart from scientists, epidemiologists and Guardian readers like myself and interprets it favourably? I wonder how we can overcome irrationality and conspiracy in society – the Great Barrington declaration that was signed by academics being a case in point – when it has scaled even the walls of the ivory tower. Desmond Hewitt Marlborough, Wiltshire • The populist vaccine deniers – who post on Facebook, for example – have had to go much further recently. They claim microbes don’t exist and there are no such things as viruses and bacteria. The entire medical world is therefore a scam, a vast global conspiracy for profit. Vaccines are the lethal tool created to cull populations as part of the secret new world order’s objective to subjugate humanity. To swallow this nonsense in the face of the evidence is not normal. Far-right politicians codify these delusions into pseudoscience that boils down to one thing – smash the state. We had better do something about the poison pouring out from social media – and soon.

    "title": "Chemtrail conspiracy theories: why RFK Jr is watching the skies",
    "content": "A conspiracy theory that airplanes are leaving nefarious “chemtrails” in their wake due to a sinister government plot has been given fresh impetus in the US amid a swirl of concerns and confusion about proposals to geoengineer a response to the climate crisis. State legislation to ban what some lawmakers call chemtrails has been pushed forward in Tennessee and, most recently, Florida. Meanwhile, Robert F Kennedy, who has expressed interest in the conspiracy theory on social media and his podcast, is set to be at the heart of Donald Trump’s new administration following his nomination as health secretary. “We are going to stop this crime,” Kennedy, who is known for his contrarian stances on vaccines and offshore wind farms, wrote about chemtrails on X in August. The former Democrat turned Trump ally said on his podcast last year that it was “kind of frightening to think that somebody may be putting large amounts of bioavailable aluminum into the environment, spraying it in microscopic particulates from airplanes”.\n\nBelievers of the chemtrails conspiracy theory contend that the white lines traced in the sky behind aircraft contain toxic chemicals that are released to achieve a devious end, such as mass sterilization or mind control. This theory, which has no evidence to support it, has been put forward at various times since the 1990s despite being repeatedly debunked. Now, scientists are faced with a resurgent focus on chemtrails amid a related, more substantive, debate over whether actual modifications to the Earth’s atmosphere should be made in a desperate attempt to slow global heating. Interest in chemtrails “bubbles up every once in a while and the hurricanes and weather modification kind of brings it up to the floor again”, said David Fahey, director of the chemical sciences laboratory at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa), in reference to two recent major hurricanes – Helene and Milton – that some figures, including Republicans, claimed were somehow steered by the federal government’s meddling with the weather. “The misinformation is abundant,” said Fahey, who has spent several decades, on and off, fielding questions about chemtrails. There was no orchestrated weather modification conducted by Noaa, Fahey said, and even experimenting with such a thing would be a “big step for our agency and one that we are not quite prepared to do at the moment, and maybe our agency shouldn’t do it”. Are chemtrails real? No. The white plumes seen from the rear of aircraft are more aptly called condensation trails, or contrails. They are essentially condensed water vapor from a plane’s exhaust that, in cold air temperatures at high altitudes, form as ice crystals that look like visible clouds. A survey of leading atmospheric scientists in 2016 found there was no evidence of a secret spraying program that would form these contrails. This research led to backlash from conspiracy theorists, with Ken Caldeira, a climate scientist who led the study, saying that he received death threats. “I felt like it was a risk to my personal safety,” he said. “People have bought into this false narrative. We’re now seeing a worrying resurgence of conspiracy theories in general, from chemtrails to vaccines. There’s a detachment from facts and rational analysis.” In fact, contrails do contribute to a form of “weather modification” – just not the sort envisioned by the conspiracy-minded. The plumes often grow into hazy cirrus clouds that trap heat and add to the greenhouse effect that is warming up the world, mostly via the burning of fossil fuels. “As with many conspiracy theories, there is some truth to it in that aircraft are releasing particles and affecting the Earth’s climate system,” said Caldeira, who is involved in an effort to get airlines to reduce their contrail output. “But this is because of unintended consequences of the fossil fuel airline system, rather than some nefarious secret reason.” Are any other weather modifications being conducted? There is a confusing stew of different processes, or just theories, with different goals that have been variously called weather modification, solar geoengineering or solar radiation management. These often get mixed up and mistaken for secret government conspiracies. Cloud seeding, for example, involves dispersing tiny particles into clouds to spur the formation of ice crystals that trigger rain or snow. Utah routinely does this to increase snowfall rates and authorities there have had to point out that this is not connected to chemtrails. A separate debate has stirred in recent years as to whether governments, or even wealthy individuals, should intervene to slow dangerous global heating by spraying reflective substances such as sulphur into the stratosphere in order to deflect sunlight from further warming the Earth. Noaa is setting up a system to monitor the stratosphere that could act as an “early warning” system for such activities. A US startup has offered “credits” for people to buy in order to help cool the world’s fever but as yet there has been no activity detected on a significant scale that would alter the climate. “There are some demonstration projects,” said Fahey. “But in terms of large-scale airplanes taking material to the stratosphere, I’m not aware of anything, certainly in our country.” Can solar geoengineering help solve the climate crisis? This year is set to be the hottest ever recorded globally, the latest in a string of hot years that are pushing the average temperature to the point it looks certain to breach the internationally agreed threshold designed to avoid catastrophic heatwaves, droughts, floods and other worsening climatic disasters. The failure of governments to stem this crisis has led to calls for more drastic interventions, like solar geoengineering, to curb the global temperature rise. Last year, the White House released a congressionally mandated report on how a research program into solar geoengineering would work. Such plans are highly controversial, however, with some scientists and environmental groups warning that meddling with the Earth’s thermostat could have unintended consequences such as altering monsoon seasons. There are also concerns about the lack of global governance around adding substances to our shared atmosphere, the potential for a huge temperature whiplash should the continual addition of sulphur via planes stop for any reason and the danger that geoengineering would distract from the primary task of cutting planet-heating emissions. Efforts by some researchers to run experiments on solar modification have been met with protests. As the world continues to heat up, though, the conversation around solar geoengineering, and related conspiracies, is unlikely to abate. “I think it’s increasingly on the agenda of people who are wondering where is our climate going and how might we influence where it’s going,” said Fahey.",

    "title": "Manchester Arena attack survivor calls for protection from conspiracy theorists",
    "content": "A survivor of the Manchester Arena attack is calling for greater legal protections from conspiracy theorists after a YouTuber with millions of viewers secretly filmed his family to try to prove they were “crisis actors”. Martin Hibbert and his daughter Eve, now 22, were left with life-changing injuries by the blast, which killed 22 people and wounded hundreds more at an Ariana Grande concert in May 2017. They were the closest people to the suicide bomber to survive but Eve suffered a severe brain injury and Hibbert, 48, was paralysed when his spinal cord was severed by shrapnel. The father and daughter were awarded £45,000 in damages in October after suing a former TV producer turned conspiracy theorist who claimed in online films that the attack was staged. In videos viewed tens of thousands of times, Richard Hall described the Arena bomb as a “well-organised and well-planned fake terrorist incident involving over 100 enlisted participants or actors” and that it involved “fabricated deaths”. Hall, a former engineer and TV producer, had also spread conspiracy theories about the murders of Jo Cox and Jill Dando, the Westminster Bridge terrorist attack, the Salisbury poisonings and the disappearance of Madeleine McCann. His YouTube channel, which was shut down in October 2022, had 84,000 followers and his videos had more than 16m views, the high court in London was told this year. The judge, Mrs Justice Steyn, condemned Hall’s conduct as “oppressive, unacceptable and of sufficient gravity to sustain criminal liability” after hearing how the YouTuber had covertly filmed Eve and her mother in September 2019 after tracking down the teenager in an effort to try to prove she was a “crisis actor”. In his first newspaper interview since the high court ruling in October, Hibbert said his family learned about the surveillance – in which Hall placed a covert recording device on his car’s dashboard, pointed at the family home – only two years later and that it had left them terrified and paranoid. “I came home one day and Gabby [his wife] was in tears and said she was scared of being in the house,” he said, adding that it had left him afraid to be alone in public until recently. “I was thinking: if anybody follows me or knows who I am, there’s nothing I can do. For me to say that and feel that … I realised it was actually affecting me more than I thought. It’s affecting our life, how we go about things.” Hibbert is planning to campaign for a new criminal offence protecting victims of crime or tragedies from harassment by conspiracy theorists, which he wants to be known as Eve’s law after his daughter. He also plans to establish a star chamber of pro-bono barristers who would represent these victims on a no-win, no-fee basis, as he said legal fees were preventing people from suing those hounding them online. Hibbert said the legal bill from his case – which involved a four-day trial at the Royal Courts of Justice – came to almost £250,000, which his law firm is attempting to recoup from Hall. “When we first had a conversation a couple of years ago my barrister said he was going to need £100,000 in an account to even look at this case. Very few, if any, could afford that,” he said. “Why should it be that only people with money can get justice? Eve’s law might also be access to justice.” Hibbert, a former football agent, has published a book about surviving the Arena attack and raising more than £1m for charity after becoming the second paraplegic person to scale Kilimanjaro in 2022. Despite two inquiries and a lengthy criminal investigation into the atrocity, he said his most difficult moment in court was being cross-examined by Hall’s barrister at the harassment trial in July. “It’s probably one of the toughest things I’ve done in life, really,” he said. “I was sat there being made to feel guilty. I was there for three hours and he [the barrister] was saying I have a public profile so I should expect it … It was really hard.” Steyn said in her ruling that Hall’s conduct had “alarmed and distressed” Hibbert and caused Eve “real, lasting and persistent anxiety, and enormous distress”. Hall has appealed against the verdict.",

    "title": "Hurricane Helene conspiracy theories collide with election misinformation",
    "content": "As emergency crews work to help people experiencing grave losses after Hurricane Helene, a wave of misinformation has accompanied relief efforts, heightened by an existential election just a month away. The upcoming election has ramped up the misinformation, a common thread of which happens after most big news events. These claims have found believers – or at least opportunistic fans – among top Republicans, who are now tying an unprecedented disaster to issues like immigration. “There’s no question that this level of falsehoods would not be spread were there not an election a month away,” said Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, a senior fellow at the American Immigration Council. The falsehoods started quickly and came from the top. Donald Trump, freshly landed in Georgia on Monday to see the storm’s devastation, claimed that the state’s governor, Brian Kemp, had not been able to reach Joe Biden to talk about disaster aid. Kemp had already said earlier in the day that he’d spoken to the president, who offered any help the state needed and said to call him directly.\n\nThe Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) put up a webpage this week to knock down the swirl of rumors it has faced – a sign of the increased myths. The American Red Cross posted on social media to dispel various falsehoods about its work. Members of Congress and state emergency management services have issued statements to insist they are working around the clock on disaster response. Elected officials who serve the area have asked constituents not to spread rumors and instead help each other. Kevin Corbin, a Republican state senator from North Carolina, posted on Facebook a plea to his followers: “Friends can I ask a small favor? Will you all help STOP this conspiracy theory junk that is floating all over Facebook and the internet about the floods.” The claims that the government is controlling the weather, that the government has denied orders for more body bags – it was all “junk”, he said, and local lawmakers are being inundated with questions about these conspiracies. “It is just a distraction to people trying to do their job. Folks, this is a catastrophic event of which this country has never known.” On Fema’s rumors page, the agency notes that it isn’t confiscating property or donations, asking for cash donations or capping recovery funds at $750 per person – all claims that are floating around online and, in some cases, elevated by rightwing media and Republican politicians. “There are many dangerous, misleading rumors spreading about Helene response, which can actively prevent survivors from getting help,” a Fema spokesperson, Jaclyn Rothenberg, said. “Our top priority is ensuring that disaster assistance is reaching people in need.” Glenn Jacobs, the Republican mayor of Knox county, Tennessee, said that to his knowledge, no one had been confiscating supplies. “Please quit spreading those rumors as they are counterproductive to response efforts,” he said. “If everyone could maybe please put aside the hate for a bit and pitch in to help, that would be great.” Elon Musk, the owner of X and key Trump ally, claimed Fema was blocking flights trying to aid the area, calling it “belligerent government incompetence”. The transportation secretary, Pete Buttigieg, responded: “No one is shutting down the airspace and FAA doesn’t block legitimate rescue and recovery flights. If you’re encountering a problem give me a call.” An AI-generated image of a young girl holding a puppy, looking devastated as she sat in a boat in the rain, seemingly fleeing the flood waters, spread widely. It was rightly flagged as AI-generated, but some didn’t seem to care. “This picture has been seared into my mind,” Amy Kremer, an RNC national committeewoman from Georgia, posted on X. She later added: “Y’all, I don’t know where this photo came from and honestly, it doesn’t matter,” saying it was “emblematic” of the reality people were facing. One myth amplified in the last few days suggests Fema is out of money because it has spent money on migrants instead, a claim that Trump and many of his allies have amplified. The story was on the cover of the New York Post. Fema is not out of money – yet. The homeland security secretary, Alejandro Mayorkas, did say earlier this week that the agency, confronting an increase in extreme weather events due to the climate crisis, will not have enough money for the remainder of the hurricane season, he said “we are meeting the immediate needs with the money that we have” for Helene. The migrant claim, however, is unrelated to Fema’s budget concerns. A separate fund, the Shelter and Services Program, administered by Fema per Congress’s directive, provides reimbursements to local governments as they deal with increased costs associated with an influx of migrants, Reichlin-Melnick said. It does not take money from disaster response. This fund started in 2019 under Trump’s administration. Reichlin-Melnick said this was an “utterly false claim” that had taken off in the past few days “because we are in a time of conspiratorial thinking, and migrants are the enemy for many on the right”. “The response is taking some time due to these very real logistical problems caused by the geography of the region and the severity of the damage,” he said. “And the federal government hasn’t been able to snap its fingers and repair things overnight … And I think you have seen a number of politicians falsely seize on this, in an effort to essentially link migrants to the hurricane.” Beyond the falsehoods with at least some link to reality, there have been suggestions that the hurricane was somehow planned or orchestrated, perhaps related to the upcoming election. This far-right fringe idea largely stayed in the darker corners of the conspiratorial internet – until Friday.",

    "title": "My husband became a conspiracy theorist. Would our marriage survive?",
    "content": "It’s a unicorn of a summer’s day in 2020; the kind that demands factor 50 and flip-flops. I’m being driven around my neighbourhood by my husband, Arlo, my hair pulled up off my neck and a cool can of something fizzy in my hand. My daily medication has kicked in: a serotonin reuptake inhibitor that I’ve taken for 15 years to ease my low-level anxiety. Without it, I’m no longer sure I can stay with this man I have loved for 12 years. I am mute and smiling passively. “There’s another one!” he points to the right. “At least it’s not disguised as a tree.” He shakes his head. “Do they think we’re idiots?” Arlo is updating me on the new 5G masts that have been covertly installed through the Trojan horse of the pandemic. It’s not the day out I’d anticipated for our Saturday, but this is our life now. What began as a polite request to turn off the microwave after use and switch off the router before bed is now the dictum that if one of these emitters of radioactive deathrays pops up on our street “we need to move”. It’s hard to pinpoint the moment that Arlo went down the conspiracy rabbit hole. Today, he can’t even answer the question for himself. He thinks it may have started with a conversation he had in the park, or a film he saw. He’d read George Orwell’s Nineteen Eighty-Four at school and it had stayed with him. What came next was a slow radicalisation through his screens and the people he met online. Maybe a curiosity fed into an algorithm that became an echo chamber. Who knows? However, there were indications that something as big as the pandemic might go this way for him. Arlo is the son of liberal parents, born rebels with anti-establishment leanings. He was conceived on the India hippy trail in the 70s. Meanwhile, I grew up in Surrey, in a mock-Tudor house opposite a tennis club. Being with me and my solid family anchored him for a while. Because, yes, I think these 5G masts are an eyesore but I don’t think they will fry my frontal cortex. In 2020, life gradually became a battleground of conspiracies with little basis in fact. The threat of 5G radiation was just the entry point: by the end of the year, my husband also believed that nanoparticles in the Covid-19 vaccine would be used to integrate us with the Internet of Things (if the vaccine didn’t kill us from myocarditis first); that digital ID would limit our travel and affect financial independence; that debt was a social construct and could be avoided using “maritime law”; and that only cryptocurrency could save us. “What’s the package?” I asked after I handed over a plump brown envelope. “Stickers,” he replied gleefully, spreading them out on the office desk. “You vil eat ze bugs!” he announced in a crude impersonation of Klaus Schwab of the World Economic Forum, an organisation that conspiracy theorists were convinced was plotting to have us all eating insects by 2030. I laughed. We were still laughing together at that point. “We do not consent to lockdown,” he read aloud from another sticker as he raced downstairs to slap it on our front door. “Oh please, not there,” I begged him. Too late. It was already glued tight and I couldn’t get my nails under the edges. On Thursdays, we hid behind the curtains of the spare room to watch our neighbours enthusiastically pound their saucepans with wooden spoons for the NHS. “Yeah, that’s right, get those jabs in,” he mocked. He sure as hell wasn’t getting his vaccination. “They’re going to close the borders,” he warned. A relative of Arlo’s had already packed his family into a van and made a break for Portugal to start a new life. Arlo was manically arguing the case for us to leave, too, but I managed to talk him down.\n\nI didn’t recognise my husband as the man I married four years earlier: a charming and adventurous photographer who missed his calling as a lead guitarist, is solid on the tennis court and does uncanny, but not unkind, impressions of our friends. Nor did those friends, or my family – most of whom blocked him from sending streams of warning content and some of whom would only see me alone. “I’ll meet you in the woods for a dog walk,” agreed Arlo’s old friend Justin. “But can you not bring Arlo? He’ll just do my head in.” Arlo knew he was being blocked by his friends, but the distancing rules meant their absence wasn’t as obvious as it would have been in different times. Which meant it increasingly fell to me to be Arlo’s sounding board. I felt battered. I took my mobile phone into quiet corners of the house to phone my closest friends, but I don’t think anyone but my family really understood the assault on my mental health. “Do you want to come round here to get a break?” my sister offered, since she lived just 10 minutes away. She could hear my distress and was angry. “I’m going to text him.” When she did, that opened a dialogue for Arlo. “Just watch this, please,” he wrote back, with a link to a documentary on vaccine injuries, and then another link to a podcast episode from Joe Rogan, and then another. There was an answer to everything if you challenged the material. Everything was binary, nothing was nuanced. Arlo had “Question the Narrative” printed on some T-shirts. At least now people could see him coming. I got dizzy trying to extract the logic from some of his arguments. “How the hell was 9/11 an inside job?” I asked, exasperated. “You should look into building No 7 at the World Trade Center. It was the biggest faux pas of mainstream media when the BBC said it had gone down … before it actually did. They knew it was going to happen. Why? Because it had debt bonds that were due to mature the next day. Then Bin Laden was flown out of the country, despite airspace being shut down.” “And how does Arlo from Crystal Palace know that?” My jaw clenched, braced for another fight. The idea that this man from a corner of England was privy to an international cover-up was ridiculous. I couldn’t accept his worldview. I had to believe in the good in people. I had to hope the pandemic was an accident and not, as Arlo believed, something inflicted on us to sell vaccines and facilitate the biggest wealth transfer in history. I remember fighting back tears after these interactions. I felt as if I was losing my grip on what was real and what wasn’t, and sometimes the evidence was even convincing. There was a link between the Covid vaccines and an increased risk of myocarditis and pericarditis, that was true; the British Heart Foundation wrote as much. I tried to dig into my journalist roots, the need to corroborate information with several parties, to find out if evidence was peer-reviewed, to show due diligence. But Arlo was impassioned and articulate and it was too overwhelming to keep up. * * * In early 2021, we sold our holiday apartment in Mallorca. Neither of us had worked much in the pandemic, living off the small furlough we received from his limited company. Arlo gave me 30% of the money from the sale and immediately started investing the rest in a slew of “alternative” crypto coins. Along with the trading came a barrage of shouty, red-faced shock jocks: BitBoy, Krypto Karl and Elon Musk were often in his ear. There was much furtive exchange of intel on Telegram. Something about cryptocurrency aligned with the ideologies he’d adopted: it promised decentralised power and transparent data on a ledger that could be read by all. I wasn’t against it, in principle. By May, Arlo had invested thousands in Dogecoin, which was also known as a “joke” or “meme” coin, namechecked in various tweets by Musk. The billionaire was due to appear on Saturday Night Live and Arlo was galvanised for a big increase in value. I also needed a night out. We went to see Cabaret in the West End of London. Arlo wasn’t into musicals, but he had always been a “yes” person; culturally engaged and up for any new experience. I loved that about him. We had cocktails, laughed and flirted. Away from any devices, we talked about the show as we walked back, hand in hand, along the Strand. Seeing the “old” Arlo being fun and caring, I felt sorry for him. He just wanted to feel control in a world that was spiralling out of it. That’s what these conspiracies gave him: a sense of being in on “the truth”. He was looking out for those he loved, worried that they would be corralled into taking vaccines that had been rushed through without a lengthy period for testing. He was our protector and the threat was a global pandemic. How could anyone behave normally in those circumstances? Still, we came home and within minutes he had his head in his hands. “What’s wrong?” I asked nervously. In the time we’d been at the theatre, Musk had been an awkward host of SNL and took part in a skit that branded Dogecoin a “hustle”. It didn’t give the market confidence. As a result, the coin had crashed in value by 29.5%. We’d lost thousands. I was too tired and overwhelmed to fight about it.",

    "title": "Refereeing conspiracy theories are nonsense but stem from valid fears | Jonathan Wilson",
    "content": "Another weekend, another slew of wearying arguments about VAR and refereeing. At Bournemouth, Arsenal fans called the referee Robert Jones “a cheat” and chanted that the Premier League was “corrupt”. On social media, the outrage was even greater. Fans have always complained about referees, of course, but traditionally they called them “blind” and dismissed them as “wankers” or “bastards”. Then came the “You’re not fit to referee” song; the cries of systemic corruption, though, are relatively new. Perhaps this is just the world we live in, one of distortions and paranoia, shaped by a diverse range of populist cynics from José Mourinho to Donald Trump, social media nurturing conspiracy theories which sprout from the fertile ground left as Covid retreated. Or perhaps there is something more complex going on.\n\nBut before we get to that, it’s worth stressing that none of the key decisions in the games involving the major title contenders at the weekend were in any sense terrible or inexplicable. William Saliba was rightly sent off in Arsenal’s defeat at Bournemouth; he deliberately pulled back Evanilson when the Brazilian was favourite to latch on to Leandro Trossard’s sliced pass, with Ben White about 30 yards away and unlikely to recover. Was the error obvious enough for VAR to intervene? Yes, clearly. Although the foul itself was not dissimilar to Tosin Adarabioyo’s on Diogo Jota in Chelsea’s defeat at Liverpool, the context was very different. The ball Jota was chasing was moving much faster and was arcing off to the right; Levi Colwill, who was around five yards away, was favourite to get to it first. Evanilson, then, was denied a goalscoring opportunity; Jota was not. The penalty Bournemouth were awarded was clear-cut, as David Raya tripped Evanilson. Even Mikel Arteta, whose constant complaints about referees have done much to encourage Arsenal fans’ persecution complex, wasn’t minded to complain, even if he didn’t go so far as to overtly accept the decisions were right. The conspiracy theory favoured by Arsenal fans seemed to be that the VAR official Jarred Gillett, an Australian, was a boyhood Liverpool fan, which is why he has never refereed a Liverpool game in the Premier League. Saliba will now be suspended for Arsenal’s game against Liverpool. But even leaving aside the frankly childish idea that professional officials cannot be objective, the basic point remains that the decision reached was the correct one. While the Saliba red card in an indirect way went for Liverpool, the two big VAR calls at Anfield both went against them: not only the non-dismissal of Adarabioyo, but also the overturning of a penalty when Robert Sánchez was deemed to have got enough on the ball before Curtis Jones went over the top of him for it not to be a foul. The case seemed borderline and Sánchez was probably saved by the fact that his forward momentum had slowed by the time of the collision. Whether VAR should have got involved is questionable, but the call was subjective; whether a penalty or not, it would be hard to say it was definitively wrong. Manchester City’s last-minute winner against Wolves falls into a similar category. It could be argued that Bernardo Silva was close enough to the Wolves keeper José Sa when John Stones headed the ball goalwards to be interfering with him. He was close enough, after all, to have bumped into Sa as the corner was taken (when he was not offside), and had Stones’s header been directed towards Sa’s right-hand post it would have passed very close to Silva. But Silva was not in his eyeline, and the header went in the middle of the goal. When Wolves had a goal disallowed in similar circumstances against West Ham last season, their manager Gary O’Neil called it “one of the worst decisions I’ve ever witnessed”; his view was notably different this time. Which is to say that while, personally, I think that sort of thing should be offside, I understand why the goal might be given and don’t think it’s scandalous that it was. But there’s no room for such grey areas from the hyper-partisan viewpoint of the modern fan, little room even for incompetence. Everything has to be part of a grand plot. Why that should not become the default is impossible to say with any certainty, but here’s a theory. Fans know the game is in grave danger; that mega-rich owners, far richer than any previous owners, have the potential to bankrupt whole competitions through repeated legal action of questionable merit. They know as well that the new breed of owners care nothing for the traditions of the game, disdaining regular fans for occasional visitors who regard a match as a day out and splurge on merchandise and overpriced stadium food. Owners are fleecing fans and reshaping the sport, dragging it away from the communities that have sustained it – and been sustained by it – for a century and a half. But that is too painful to accept. Against their might, the average fan is helpless and so, in a classic case of discomfort displacement, perhaps blinded by partisanship, they turn instead on the familiar enemy: referees.

    "title": "Trump: The Criminal Conspiracy Case review – outstanding but blood-chilling ",
    "content": "Towards the end of the outstanding, thriller-ish documentary Trump: The Criminal Conspiracy Case, I find myself transfixed by a courtroom exchange that seems ripped straight from the script of a legal drama. Ashleigh Merchant, currently representing one of Donald Trump’s co-defendants in the Georgia election interference case, is a former friend of Fulton County district attorney Fani T Willis. While Willis’s own lawyer argues that the DA should not have to testify about her romantic relationship with special prosecutor Nathan Wade, and whether it would constitute impropriety, Willis enters the courtroom dramatically. On the stand, she coolly tells Merchant that she has been “anxious to have this conversation with you today”, her tone steely and tough. As I say, gripping. It is like an episode of The Good Wife. This is part of the problem, of course. The future of democracy in the United States has been reduced to a salacious spectacle and it is difficult to remain focused on the issue at hand. Thinking that it’s like a TV drama, likening it to entertainment, is buying into the culture of being unable to take even the most important issues seriously. Still, television as precise as Trump: The Criminal Conspiracy Case comes in handy. It retains focus throughout its 90 minutes, and proves a rare example of a programme that doesn’t seem long enough. It is a lean, effective and chilling summary of exactly what Trump and 18 others have been accused of in Georgia: attempting to overturn the results of the 2020 US presidential election. (This is just one of the four criminal cases against him.) Even if you are already familiar with the case, it is sobering and depressingly refreshing to have it all laid out with such calmness and clarity. The first hour follows the period from election night in November 2020, when Trump first claimed that he had in fact won the crucial swing state of Georgia, despite the results, to the day after the Capitol riots in January 2021. It pieces together the case against Trump and his codefendants by collecting the evidence that suggested there was a case to be brought. Using courtroom footage, CCTV, police bodycam footage, recordings of calls to the emergency services and impressive interviews with several key figures on both sides, it manages to establish why there is so much obfuscating noise around these events, while simultaneously stripping it away to reveal the bare bones of what prosecutors allege took place. It does occasionally leave gaps, presumably for legal reasons, though this is frustrating in a documentary so concerned with conspiracy theories. Trump defenders claim the case is politically motivated sabotage. The film examines each of the targets chosen for blame by Trump and his team: the two women accused of falsifying votes during a count; the company that manufactures voting machines, whose employees were accused of fiddling with “the chips”; and former vice president Mike Pence, who emerges as an unlikely defender of democracy. The way this film tells it, the democratic system was frighteningly close to collapse, which offers a blood-chilling pre-Halloween horror story for anyone anxious about the November rerun. It is hard to come away from this without wondering whether the entire system is fraying at the edges. There are plenty of shocking details, but what stands out most is that those shouting “fraud” at the highest volume are also those capable of being the most reckless with the lives of ordinary working people. Those caught up in what appear to be baseless accusations of wrongdoing have had their lives turned upside down. They have been threatened, targeted, abused; they have lost friends, homes and any sense of security and safety, seemingly at the behest of their former president. People talk of a need for armed guards, secret entrances, disguises and a plan for what they will do if a man who holds strong grudges is returned to the highest office in the United States. One interviewee says this will involve fleeing the country. The film waits until the very end to point out that these are extraordinary times in US politics, as if it needs saying. This is an enthralling account of not just the Georgia case, which continues to unspool, but of a nation in a state of turmoil, and the grievances that are powering this continuing stormy season. • Trump: The Criminal Conspiracy Case aired on BBC Two and is on iPlayer now",

    "title": "Conspiracy of silence? Why business leaders are so quiet on Trump",
    "content": "After the January 6 attack on the US Capitol, America’s business leaders came out strongly in their criticism of Donald Trump. Now – as the Harris campaign brands Trump a “fascist” and Trump threatens retribution against “the enemy from within” – there appears to be a conspiracy of silence. In fact, as the nation heads to the polls in an election that is too close to call, some of America’s most powerful chief executives appear to be cozying up to Trump again. In public, only a small handful of business leaders are backing Trump. In private it’s a different story. At least, that’s how Trump is telling it. Over the last few weeks, he’s bragged about the warm reception he’s receiving from CEOs. At a recent rally, he said that the Google chief, Sundar Pichai, had called him with praise about his photoshoot at a McDonald’s in Pennsylvania. The Apple chief, Tim Cook, reportedly called him to discuss the company’s legal troubles in Europe. Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg was said to have called him over the summer after his assassination attempt. And then, after years of fielding attacks from Trump over his ownership of the Washington Post, Jeff Bezos blocked the paper’s endorsement of Kamala Harris. Bezos said the paper wouldn’t do endorsements, as it had for half a century, to avoid perceptions of media bias. It all seems like an about-face compared with a few years ago, when the same executives were praising Joe Biden’s win and openly criticizing Trump over the January 6 attack. And Trump is very much the same person: he has continued to insist that the insurrection was actually a “day of love” and has made clear he will not accept the results of the election if he loses. “That’s the only way we’re gonna lose, because they cheat,” he said at a rally in September. But what may appear as silence from America’s chief executives is actually restraint, according to some in the business community. “They have an obligation to work with whomever is president, so they don’t want to come across as hostile and unable to work with him,” said Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, a Yale professor who tracks the political preferences of C-suite executives. “But what is an undeniable historic fact is that there has never been in American history a less popular president with the nation’s business leadership than Donald Trump.” In an open letter in support of Harris, a dozen former CEOs brought together by Sonnenfeld said Trump was “anti-business”. “While each of us has different political affiliations, we are coming together to vote for Kamala Harris in this presidential election – and we believe the majority of sitting CEOs will do the same,” the letter reads. Sonnenfeld pointed out that executives historically support Republican candidates. But only one CEO in the Fortune 100 has publicly endorsed Trump: Elon Musk. “He’s got one. That’s pretty telling,” Sonnenfeld said. “John McCain and Mitt Romney had half of the business community. In 2016, it fell to zero.”\n\nTrump’s first term was a boon for corporations, who saved $240bn from 2018 to 2021 thanks to the former president’s cuts to corporate tax, which he says he will lower again in a second term. But Sonnenfeld said many business leaders were not fans of Trump’s plans for tariffs and for mass deportations, two major policies he’s been touting on the campaign trail, along with possible politicization of the Federal Reserve. “They hate the way Trump creates wedge issues and false propaganda to divide the nation, whether it’s their personal values … in institutions, or just the belief that the free enterprise system can’t function if there isn’t residual trust in communities,” he said. Daniella Ballou-Aares, chief executive of the Leadership Now Project, said many of Trump’s wealthy supporters aren’t actually sitting executives. “The press narrative focuses on a very short list of men on both sides who are just not indicative [of the climate],” Ballou-Aares said. “There are many, many different kinds of groups coming together on the business side” who are supporting Harris, she said. But leaders have to tread a fine line, especially because Trump is known to be unashamedly transactional. In May, he stunned a group of oil and gas executives when he told them they should be donating $1bn to his campaign – what would actually be a “deal” considering he would reverse environmental rules and would lower taxes. During his previous term, he rewarded his closest supporters with a direct line to the White House. Trump has vowed to unleash retribution on those who speak against him should he take office again, and executives don’t want to get their company on the receiving end of a Trump backlash. Some have already experienced the tidal wave of abuse that can be triggered from just seeming to be “woke” – taking on Trump head-on is a business gamble they have so far avoided. “If they were these billionaires just investing their own wallet, then you can be more flamboyant. But they have custodial oversight for all the stakeholders in their communities, and their workforce and their customers,” Sonnenfeld said. “They know this is a very divided country, and they don’t want to trigger anything unnecessarily.” It’s also a different political environment compared with the 2020 election, when the Covid pandemic still kept many under lockdown, and the Black Lives Matter protests from the summer had forced a racial reckoning throughout the business world. When Biden became president, companies saw fewer demands from consumers and employees to speak out. Instead, companies have seen more backlash from conservative groups. Corporations are people too – at least according to the supreme court – and it seems Trump’s bullying has silenced them. “I think the danger of the last few years is that it’s been more than just quiet, it’s been chilled,” said Elizabeth Doty, director of the corporate political taskforce at the Erb Institute at the University of Michigan. “Companies have been really worried about making commitments … that they couldn’t back up, or that would expose them to attacks, legal and reputational.” Doty said that where companies were once reactive to politics, leaders are trying to make their companies more adaptive to the political climate – an evolution that still has people wondering what many companies stand for. “They’re trying to position themselves as politically neutral as a principled stance, but it’s coming across as opportunistic. It invites them to become more of a political football,” Doty said. When thinking about how companies can come out on political and social issues, Doty and other researchers have found that it’s important that companies emphasize upholding institutions, like government and the election process, even when they are trying to remain politically neutral. When Bezos published his op-ed explaining why he blocked the Post’s presidential endorsement less than two weeks away from the election, he referred to it as a “principled decision”. “I assure you that my views here are, in fact, principled,” he wrote. But in the op-ed, Bezos was not clear on exactly what his principles are, only that he believes that Americans are distrustful of the media. “Being principled means being clear about what you’re for, not who you are against,” Doty said. “There’s always a way to do that that is not antagonistic to a candidate.” While the pre-election period is a sensitive time to take political stances, the post-election story – once the results are starting to become clear – will be different for business leaders. “They’re all poised and ready to jump into action, as they’ve done before, should there be a catastrophic tantrum,” Sonnenfeld said. Ballou-Aares with the Leadership Now Project gathered signatures from dozens of business leaders calling on candidates to comply with election laws and accept the legitimacy of the election. “We need to make sure there’s a very broad coalition to support the legitimacy of the election process itself,” Ballou-Aares said. “If we’re in a situation where we’re in a closely contested election, there will be efforts to weaken the coalition.” Public silence and private politicking makes business sense now. Should Trump win next week, corporate America will face a bigger test.",

    "title": "AI can change belief in conspiracy theories, study finds",
    "content": "Whether it is the mistaken idea that the moon landings never happened or the false claim that Covid jabs contain microchips, conspiracy theories abound, sometimes with dangerous consequences. Now researchers have found that such beliefs can be altered by a chat with artificial intelligence (AI). “Conventional wisdom will tell you that people who believe in conspiracy theories rarely, if ever, change their mind, especially according to evidence,” said Dr Thomas Costello, a co-author of the study from American University. That, he added, is thought to be down to people adopting such beliefs to meet various needs – such as a desire for control. However, the new study offers a different stance.\n\n“Our findings fundamentally challenge the view that evidence and arguments are of little use once someone has ‘gone down the rabbit hole’ and come to believe a conspiracy theory,” the team wrote. Crucially, the researchers said, the approach relies on an AI system that can draw on a vast array of information to produce conversations that encourage critical thinking and provide bespoke, fact-based counterarguments. “The AI knew in advance what the person believed and, because of that, it was able to tailor its persuasion to their precise belief system,” said Costello. Writing in the journal Science, Costello and colleagues reported how they carried out a series of experiments involving 2,190 participants with a belief in conspiracy theories. While the experiments varied slightly, all participants were asked to describe a particular conspiracy theory they believed and the evidence they thought supported it. This was then fed into an AI system called “DebunkBot”. Participants were also asked to rate on a 100-point scale how true they thought the conspiracy theory was. They then knowingly undertook a three-round back-and-forth conversation with the AI system about their conspiracy theory or a non-conspiracy topic. Afterwards, participants once more rated how true they thought their conspiracy theory was. The results revealed those who discussed non-conspiracy topics only slightly lowered their “truth” rating afterwards. However, those who discussed their conspiracy theory with AI showed, on average, a 20% drop in their belief that it was true. The team said the effects appeared to hold for at least two months, while the approach worked for almost all types of conspiracy theory – although not those that were true. The researchers added that the size of the effect depended on factors including how important the belief was to the participant and their trust in AI. “About one in four people who began the experiment believing a conspiracy theory came out the other end without that belief,” said Costello. “In most cases, the AI can only chip away – making people a bit more sceptical and uncertain – but a select few were disabused of their conspiracy entirely.” The researchers added that reducing belief in one conspiracy theory appeared to reduce participants’ belief in other such ideas, at least to a small degree, while the approach could have applications in the real world – for example, AI could reply to posts relating to conspiracy theories on social media. Prof Sander van der Linden of the University of Cambridge, who was not involved in the work, questioned whether people would engage with such AI voluntarily in the real world. He also said it was unclear if similar results would be found if participants had chatted with an anonymous human, while there are also questions about how the AI was convincing conspiracy believers, given the system also uses strategies such as empathy and affirmation. But, he added: “Overall, it’s a really novel and potentially important finding and a nice illustration of how AI can be leveraged to fight misinformation.”",

    "title": "Conspiracy theorist Kash Patel, Trump’s pick to lead FBI, faces Senate blowback",
    "content": "Donald Trump’s plan to nominate as FBI director the “deep state” conspiracy theorist Kash Patel, a virulent critic of the bureau who has threatened to fire its top echelons and shut down the agency’s headquarters, is facing blowback in Congress as US senators begin to flex their muscles ahead of a contentious confirmation process. Politicians from both main parties took to the Sunday talk shows to express starkly divergent views on Patel, whom Trump announced on Saturday as his pick to lead the most powerful law enforcement agency in the US. The move is dependent on the incumbent FBI chief, Christopher Wray, who Trump himself placed in the job in 2017, either being fired or resigning. It is already clear that confirming Patel through the US Senate is likely to be less than plain sailing. Mike Rounds, a Republican senator from South Dakota, indicated that Patel could face a tough confirmation battle.\n\nRounds pointedly sang the praises of the existing FBI director in an interview with ABC’s This Week. He said that Wray, who still has three more years of his 10-year term to serve, was a “very good man”, adding that he had “no objections about the way that he is doing his job right now”. The senator also emphasised the separation of powers between president and Senate, signaling possible trouble for Patel. Rounds said he gave presidents “the benefit of the doubt”, but also emphasised that “we have a constitutional role to play … that’s the process”. Other Republican senators rallied to Patel’s side. Ted Cruz, the senator from Texas, told CBS’s Face the Nation that he believed Patel would be confirmed. “Patel is a very strong nominee to take on the partisan corruption of the FBI.” Bill Hagerty, a Republican senator from Tennessee, said on NBC’s Meet the Press that he would vote to confirm Patel. “Kash is the best at uncovering what’s happened to the FBI and I look forward to seeing him taking it apart,” he said. Patel is a Trump loyalist who has published children’s books featuring “King Donald”. He has long denigrated the FBI as a pillar of what he calls the “deep state” or the “corrupt ruling class”. In an interview with Shawn Ryan in September, Patel vowed to “shut down” the FBI’s headquarters in Washington DC and reopen the building the following day as a “museum of the deep state”. He has also threatened to use the power of federal law enforcement to go after those he claims are responsible for corrupting the federal government, a list of whom he published in his memoir. Jake Sullivan, Joe Biden’s current national security adviser, was among that list: Patel called him “one of the corrupt actors of the first order”. Sullivan was asked by ABC’s This Week whether he was worried personally about Patel’s potential leadership of the FBI, given the threats against him. He declined to comment, saying he was wholly focused on keeping the country safe in the remaining 50 days of his term in office. But he did highlight that Biden had kept Wray on as FBI chief, despite having inherited the official from Trump. Sullivan said that Wray served “with distinction, entirely insulated from politics or the partisan preferences of the current sitting president. This is a good, deep bipartisan tradition that President Biden has adhered to.” Jamie Raskin, a House Democrat from Maryland, challenged the claim by Trump and Patel that the FBI had been politically weaponised under Biden to go after Republicans. He pointed out on CNN’s State of the Union that over the past four years the FBI had prosecuted the disgraced Democratic senator from New Jersey, Bob Menendez, and the Texas Democrat Henry Cuellar. “I think that’s what they mean when they talk about politicization in the deep state – anybody who doesn’t do the will of Donald Trump,” Raskin said. According to an Axios report on Sunday, Trump had initially planned to appoint Patel as deputy FBI director but changed his mind after his pick to head the agency, the state attorney general of Missouri, Andrew Bailey, failed to impress him. Raising Patel to the number one position makes the move far more politically loaded. Despite the storm he is generating, Trump shows no sign of moderating his leadership choices for his upcoming administration. Over the weekend he tapped Charles Kushner, father of his son-in-law Jared Kushner and a convicted felon whom Trump pardoned in 2020, as US ambassador to France.",

    "title": "Melania Trump boosts conspiracy theory online about rally shooting",
    "content": "Former first lady Melania Trump has raised questions around the law enforcement response to the attempted assassination of her husband, in a video she published on Tuesday to promote her new book. In the 34-second video posted to her X account, Melania begins by describing the attempted assassination on her husband as a “horrible, distressing experience”. And now, she says in the video, which is overlayed with dramatic instrumental music, “the silence around it feels heavy”. “I can’t help but wonder why didn’t law enforcement officials arrest the shooter before the speech?” she asks in the video. “There is definitely more to this story and we need to uncover the truth.” The video then cuts to black and then ends with an image of the cover to her new memoir, Melania, and a link to buy copies. Donald Trump himself has recently, without any evidence, blamed Joe Biden and Kamala Harris for the assassination attempt and accused them of making it difficult for the Secret Service to have the staffing to protect him. Conspiracy theories around the shooting have spread in some Republican and rightwing circles. There has been no evidence that the US president or vice-president were directly involved in or interfered with the Secret Service’s arrangements, or that there was any wider plot to attack Trump beyond the lone shooter, who was killed moments after opening fire. On Melania’s website, it states her memoir, which she describes as “the powerful and inspiring story of a woman who has defined personal excellence, overcome adversity, and carved her own path” is available to pre-order for $40. A signed edition is also available for $75, and a collector’s edition, which includes a signature, bonus photographs and a “digital collectable”, is on sale for $250. Since the assassination attempt on the former president on 13 July in Pennsylvania, where 20-year-old Thomas Crooks opened fire on Trump as he spoke at a campaign rally, the FBI and Secret Service have come under intense scrutiny and criticism over security issues at the event. Trump survived the shooting but sustained an injury to his ear, and one rally attendee was killed in the attack and two others were injured. The gunman was shot dead by a Secret Service officer at the scene.\n\nThe remarks by the former first lady on Tuesday come as investigations are under way looking into what happened that day, as well as the decisions and actions of personnel leading up to the event. New details have emerged in the last two months regarding the lead-up to 13 July, apparent security and communication failings by and between law enforcement agencies, as well as new details on the shooter himself, such as his search history and preparations for the attack, but FBI officials have not yet uncovered a motive for the attack. In late July, the director of the Secret Service resigned after a hearing where she was criticized by lawmakers over the apparent security failures around the shooting, and of failing to answer some specific questions about what went wrong. A day later, the House voted to form a taskforce to investigate the failings around the rally security and in late August, at least five US Secret Service agents were placed on leave in relation to the 13 July rally.",

    "title": "How conspiracy theories are damaging democracy | Letters",
    "content": "Thank you, Amelia Gentleman, for your article about Brent Lee (Escape from the rabbit hole: the conspiracy theorist who abandoned his dangerous beliefs, 4 October). He is exceptional for two reasons. First, he managed to pull himself out of the rabbit hole of conspiracy theories on his own, and second, he is attempting to inspire his former conspiracy partners to rethink their absurd beliefs. When you read the US author Steven Hassan’s works on cults, you realise how difficult it is for an individual to abandon these belief systems cold turkey. Normally, it takes hours of active listening and therapy to correct the psychological damage these conspiracies cause. On the outside looking in, these cults are so absurd that it is easy to mock them. But we know now that it only takes a political scientist and a charismatic leader to figure out how to activate a conspiratorial mindset to occupy the US Capitol and launch a coup. Then suddenly your derision is turned to shock and horror. Very few are as insightful as Brent. I hope he keeps at it. Martin Linskey Rochester, New York, US • Unfortunately, here on Merseyside the democratic process is under attack from far-right conspiracy theorists. It’s no longer about a group of harmless flat-Earthers or people who think Prince Philip was a lizard. They are now peddling white supremacist ideas on Telegram and Facebook, and turning up to disrupt council meetings to shout about 20mph zones. When Tory politicians pander to them by openly suggesting that we will all be trapped in 15-minute cities, I despair. The rot has spread further than I thought and we need to counter it fast. Name and address supplied • Among all the lies mentioned in Peter Walker’s roundup of the Tories’ carousel of untruths (From 15-minute cities to bananas: why do Tories seem to be bending the truth?, 4 October), one whopper stands out. Mark Harper’s comment describing 15-minute cities as “sinister”, suggesting that they mean that “councils can decide how often you go to the shops, and that they can ration who uses the roads and when”, is much more dangerous than it is ridiculous. Taken at its best, it purports that councils have the time, the resources and the authority to police people’s lives instead of managing increasingly smaller budgets and being forced to make difficult decisions about leisure centres, parks, libraries, community centres and a dwindling housing stock, among other issues. At its worst, it plays into the fears and rage of vulnerable, impressionable people, validating their worst and most conspiratorial instincts. It seems to me that these are the people who urgently need to feel part of their community and climb out of the rabbit hole while they still can. The Tories repeatedly underestimate how much this nation cares about public services and if Labour has any sense, it will use them to counter the isolation that creates this disinformation. Seán McGovern London • To avoid falling for conspiracy theories, as Brent Lee unfortunately did, I apply this simple criterion: if a conspiracy theory looks too daft to be true, it probably is.

    "title": "Conspiracy theories swirl around Russell Brand allegations",
    "content": "After allegations of sexual assault and rape against the comedian Russell Brand were published, some were quick to take up conspiracy theories about why they had been published. Brand set the wheels in motion when he published a video in which he rebutted the allegations the night before they were aired and claimed they were linked to an attack on his freedom of speech. He said he was the victim of a “coordinated attack” from the mainstream media outlets who published the allegations – the Times, the Sunday Times and Channel 4’s Dispatches – and that there was a “serious and concerted agenda” to control his voice. He compared his experience to the media critique of Joe Rogan, the US podcaster who has been accused of promoting falsehoods and misinformation about Covid vaccines. “It’s been clear to me, or at least it feels to me, like there’s a serious and concerted agenda to control these kind of spaces, and these kind of voices, and I mean my voice along with your voice,” he said, signing off by telling his followers to “stay free”. An investigation spanning a number of years, and published on Saturday by the Sunday Times, revealed that Brand had been accused of sexual assault, rape and predatory behaviour between 2006 and 2013 by four women. Brand denies all the accusations. According to the paper’s report, one woman claimed she had a relationship with Brand when she was 16 and he was 31, and alleged that he would refer to her as “the child” and encourage her to lie to her parents. Another woman alleges that Brand raped her against a wall in his Los Angeles home and that she visited a rape crisis centre the same day. She received therapy there for the next five months. Hours after the allegations emerged on Saturday, Brand performed at a sold-out gig at the 2,000-capacity Troubadour Wembley Park theatre in north-west London where he received a standing ovation from fans. He apparently told the crowd there were certain things he could not talk about during the show. While Brand was being dropped by his talent agency and a charity he was affiliated with, those who came to his aid included Elon Musk, the billionaire entrepreneur and owner of X (formerly Twitter), who responded to his video statement: “Of course. They don’t like competition.” He also replied to another tweet defending Brand, saying: “No more canceling. Enough is enough.” The self-proclaimed misogynist influencer Andrew Tate, who is awaiting trial in Romania on charges of rape and human trafficking, announced to his followers that he would hold an “emergency meeting” on Sunday evening to “tell everybody the truth about what’s happening to Russell Brand”. “I know things I shouldn’t know,” he said. He had already tweeted Brand saying “Welcome to the club”, and shared a post saying that Brand was getting the “Andrew Tate treatment”. The former Fox News host Tucker Carlson also posted on X suggesting the allegations were linked to Brand’s views on topics such as “drug companies … and the war in Ukraine”. The GB News host Beverley Turner said Brand was welcome on her show “any time” and that he was being attacked for creating “autonomous, knowing and original content” on his channels. Brand’s sister-in-law, the television presenter Kirsty Gallacher, initially seemed to show support, sharing his video statement on her Instagram story with a red love heart, although she later deleted it. Brand has amassed a large following on social media – 3.8 million accounts on Instagram, 2.2 million on TikTok and 6.6 million on YouTube – with his videos often featuring interviews with far-right influencers and promoting conspiracy theories on issues such as the Covid pandemic, the war in Ukraine and the climate crisis. Videos he has posted in recent weeks include titles such as “What REALLY started the Hawaii fire?”, “State of fear! Covid propaganda exposed!” and “Zelensky’s MASSIVE Ukraine censorship EXPOSED.” One of his videos was removed from YouTube last year for allegedly “spreading Covid misinformation”, prompting him to move to the video channel Rumble, where he livestreams almost daily.",

    "title": " The rural Michigan town fighting against rightwing conspiracy theories",
    "content": "In early October, Beverly Sharp addressed a table of poll workers, elections officials and activists gathered in rural Adams Township, Michigan, with a prayer. “Father, we thank you for this opportunity to meet together to discuss things, and to agree if we agree, and if we disagree, [to be] friendly,” said the longtime poll worker. It was a plea lodged in earnest ahead of an unprecedented election year. Hillsdale county – where Adams is located – has been roiled by election conspiracy theories since the 2020 election, and officials say a growing rightwing movement is now stoking fears of political violence ahead of the 2024 election. Across the county, where 73% of voters supported Donald Trump in 2020, questions of election denialism and far-right politics have split the community. A faction of the Hillsdale county GOP, dubbed the “America First Republicans”, split off from more traditional conservatives following the January 6 Capitol riot, when Trump and his allies tried to overturn his election loss. In October, the group appointed a new chair: David Stone, the former leader of the Michigan-based Christian Hutaree Militia. “The [election] next year will be really bad,” said Adams Township clerk Suzy Roberts, who is tasked with running the town’s elections. Roberts took office in May, ousting a conspiracy theory-touting clerk in a recall election that also removed a far-right supervisor from the township board in hopes of bringing stability to the politically fractious community following a series of alarming incidents. A former member of America First Republicans told the Guardian in April that she had faced slurs, harassment, and threats after she left the group – prompting her to file a police report. Sharp, who is 93 and campaigned for the May recall, described a harrowing encounter at a township meeting with a member of the America First Republicans in 2020. “He shouted, ‘You stupid F-ing women,’” said Sharp, and followed her and another longtime poll worker “all the way out into the parking lot”. The chair of the far-right group, Stone, said he opposed harassment and was unaware of threatening behavior by members. When asked about his past involvement with the Hutaree Militia – and community members concerned about militia activity in general – Stone pointed to his acquittal in a federal sedition case in 2012. “Anybody who’s got a problem with Hutaree Militia, why don’t you sit down and look and see what an acquittal means,” said Stone. “We’re 11 years past that, and people are still trying to drag this out.” The case followed an FBI sting which the prosecution claimed had found evidence the Hutaree were planning an armed revolt. Citing insufficient evidence of a concrete plan, a federal judge dismissed the sedition and conspiracy charges, leaving Stone with a weapons violation.\n\nThe threat to elections in Hillsdale county is now twofold. While tensions in the community devolved into open hostility following the last presidential election, the infrastructure for elections administration has also been crumbling for years. Stephanie Scott, the election clerk who Roberts was elected to replace, spent much of her time in office casting doubts on the results of the 2020 election. She was stripped of her right to administer elections by Michigan’s secretary of state after she refused to submit voting machines for routine maintenance. Scott’s actions in office earned her national attention and support from conspiracy theorists like former Overstock.com CEO Patrick Byrne, who was part of Trump’s inner circle and peddled the president’s false claims about the 2020 election. Scott’s attorney, Stefanie Lambert, faces charges in connection with an alleged effort by Trump allies to illegally access voting machines in 2020. Voters in the conservative town – many of whom themselves questioned the 2020 election results – became exasperated with the divisive politics on the township board, and voted by 406-214 to oust Scott in May. In the same election they also removed township supervisor Mark Nichols, who supported Scott’s actions, and replaced him with township supervisor Randy Johnson. (Scott did not agree to an interview and did not answer questions for this story.) Since Roberts took over, things have gotten better. “We have a clerk that we can work with now,” said Abe Dane, the Hillsdale county chief deputy clerk whose office was temporarily tasked with running Adams Township elections after the state stripped Scott of her duties. “From that standpoint, it’s been a great improvement.” But the transition has its own challenges. Roberts is rushing to learn and implement new statewide elections policies ahead of 2024 while continuing to push back against false conspiracy theories. Videos have circulated on a local YouTube channel, alleging fraudsters in state government are sabotaging elections, while voting machines communicate with foreign countries on the internet. To run local elections, new clerks must learn to work with Michigan’s voter rolls and become fluent in policies governing voter registration, overseas voters, and absentee voting. On top of that, Michigan recently passed a constitutional amendment creating an early voting period and allowing people to permanently vote absentee – a move that will expand voting access but has administrators scrambling to implement the new rules. To make matters more complicated, Roberts said that parts of her office’s budget were in disarray when she came onboard. At a 9 October township meeting, Roberts alleged Scott was responsible for the “mess,” saying: “It has caused a lot of turmoil.” (Scott denied that the issues came from her tenure as clerk). Even basic logistical questions such as how to run early voting have become the source of controversy and misinformation, officials said. The Adams Township board agreed to have local voters cast their early ballots at a single county-wide location shared with other towns rather than open up a separate voting location to limit extra work. But Scott loudly objected in a speech that a local rightwing group posted to YouTube, claiming the measure would compromise the security of elections. “You guys just sold out Adams Township,” she said. Scott has continued to attend township meetings, and she and her allies have decried “centralized elections”, invoking a conspiracy theory that state officials want to have fewer elections hubs so they can more easily rig the elections and accusing local officials of aiding that scheme. And those meetings have continued to be fraught. Gail McClanahan, who organized the recall campaign, said she was confronted by a handful of rightwing activists after a recent township board meeting. As she tried to leave, McClanahan said the group blocked her path threateningly. “They all four stood there, and I had to go out around,” said McClanahan, adding that they were “mouthing off” at her. McClanahan’s experience prompted Johnson, the new town supervisor, to warn attendees at the next township meeting to stay civil. “I would like to bring up a topic that really should never even have to be spoken,” he said in early October. “This is a public meeting. You should be able to come here, and be able to just listen to what’s said, voice your opinion, and when you leave that door you should be able to go home in peace.”",

    "title": "Disguises, subterfuge and conspiracy: college football’s sign-stealing scandal explained",
    "content": "What are Michigan accused of? The Big Ten, the conference in which Michigan play, and college sports’ main governing body, the NCAA, claim that Michigan used a “vast network” of people to tape the sidelines of future opponents, both in and out of the conference, across the last three seasons. Michigan and their head coach, Jim Harbaugh, deny any knowledge of the alleged cheating. On Friday the Big Ten banned Harbaugh from the sidelines on gamedays for the rest of the 2023 regular season, although he will be able to work with his players during the week. The suspension is huge news in the world of college football, as Michigan are contenders for the national championship this season and Harbaugh one of the biggest personalities in the sport. The Wolverines’ average attendance for home games tops 110,000 and they haul in tens of millions of dollars in revenue each year. Is sign-stealing illegal? Unlike in the NFL, there is no coach-to-player communication system in college football. Instead of calling in plays via a headset in the quarterback’s helmet, staff communicate with their players through hand signals and graphics on the sideline. If an opponent can decode those signals, they will have advanced knowledge of the play. Stealing signs is a time-honored tradition across US sports. In the frenzied, multi-billion-dollar world of college football, trying to decode an opposing team’s signs is a part of everyday life. Teams allocate staffers to review what’s known as the ‘coaches film’ or All-22 video of opponents in the run-up to games, as well as evaluating the ‘TV copy’ of the game to try to decipher the opponent’s signals. During games, teams will compare their pre-game notes with what they’re seeing on the opposing sideline to confirm whether they have cracked the code or not. Sign stealing in the week leading up to the game and during the game itself is part of the game within a game. What is banned under NCAA legislation is advanced scouting in person. In the 1990s, the NCAA banned schools from sending staff members to the games of future opponents. Staff members of the school are no longer able to attend the games of future opponents on their schedule, where they can have a better vantage point of the sidelines. Videotaping another team’s signals is banned under both NCAA and Big Ten legislation. So how did Michigan skirt the rules? The scheme, it is alleged, was orchestrated by Michigan staffer Connor Stalions, a retired captain in the US Marines who worked as a recruiting analyst for the school.\n\nStalions is a lifelong Michigan fan who presented a 600-page ‘Michigan Manifesto’ to the school before being hired as a volunteer. He joined the staff full-time prior to the 2022 season. In texts revealed by Sports Illustrated, Stalions boasted of sign-stealing and his close relationship with Michigan’s staff. “I’ve grown up my entire life with a vision to coach football at Michigan,” Stalions told Soldiers to Sidelines in 2022. Reviews of TV footage have shown Stalions standing next to Michigan coordinators across multiple seasons, holding a laminated copy of signs. Other Big Ten schools told ESPN that they had proof that tickets bought through a third-party app were bought under Stalions’s name. Tickets were purchased to games against future Michigan opponents on the 50-yard line, the ideal vantage to view teams’ signals. Yahoo Sports reported that Stalions also bought tickets to games involving schools outside the Big Ten who would be potential opponents if Michigan made the College Football Playoff. Yahoo Sports also reported that TCU were aware of Michigan’s sign-stealing team before the sides faced off in the 2022 College Football Playoff. TCU then used ‘dummy signals’ in their 51-45 semi-final win, alternating between the signs they knew Michigan had decoded and fresh signs to mislead Michigan’s coaching staff and players. After the NCAA and Big Ten acknowledged they had launched an investigation into Michigan, Yahoo Sports initially reported that the school had fired Stalions before Michigan released a statement saying that Stalions had resigned. In a statement provided by his attorney, Stalions said that no member of the Michigan coaching staff, including Harbaugh, had any knowledge of rule-breaking or improper conduct regarding advanced scouting. But isn’t sign stealing commonplace?",

    "title": "Hypnotic and the best conspiracy thrillers",
    "content": "Conspiracy thrillers can excel in two ways. Some strike with enough chilling plausibility to change the way you see the world, or at least the powers controlling it, while others delight with the sheer foil-hatted bonkersness of their plotting. Hypnotic, an elaborately loopy sci-fi conspiracy twister from B-movie stalwart Robert Rodriguez, falls firmly and unapologetically into the latter category. Audiences weren’t persuaded – it tanked in cinemas – but I think it has the makings of classic midnight-marathon fodder. This is, after all, a film about a gruff cop (a remarkably straight-faced Ben Affleck) gradually uncovering, in the course of investigating his daughter’s disappearance, an elite group of hypnotists behind a spate of bank heists and more seismic world events. Things somehow get more absurd from there, in what plays like a delirious fusion of Christopher Nolan and The Twilight Zone.\n\nIf anything, Rodriguez’s film is a goofy throwback to the more rigorous stylings of one of the earliest great conspiracy films: in Fritz Lang’s 1922 expressionist masterwork Dr Mabuse, the Gambler (Internet Archive), the eponymous criminal mastermind (with, yes, powers of hypnosis) uses occult forces to control the global stock market. Alfred Hitchcock, of course, successfully steered the conspiracy thriller away from outright fantasy and into taut, it-could-happen-to-you tension – never better than in The 39 Steps (1935), with its spiralling story of an ordinary man wrongly accused of murder and caught up in a global espionage plot. In the 1960s, the cold war brought with it a new, fretful wave of conspiracy fear-mongering in cinemas, best exemplified by John Frankenheimer’s 1962 icy mind-control thriller The Manchurian Candidate. With its tale of a brainwashed war veteran fronting a plot to overthrow the US government, it encapsulated the era’s anti-communist hysteria with some sly degree of satire. (By the time it was remade, efficiently enough, by Jonathan Demme in 2004, it just didn’t pack the same punch.)",

    "title": "Trump praises ‘terrific’ white supremacist conspiracy theorist ",
    "content": "In an online video, Donald Trump praised the white nationalist conspiracy theorist Laura Loomer as “terrific” and “very special” and said: “You are a very opinionated lady, I have to tell you. And in my opinion, I like that.”\n\nLoomer, 30, is a Florida activist and failed political candidate who once described herself as a “proud Islamophobe”, earning bans from major social media platforms. Among proliferating controversies, Loomer has called Muslims “savages” and Islam a “cancer”. She has spread conspiracy theories about mass shootings, including the Parkland school shooting in Florida. Trump endorsed Loomer in 2020, when she won a Republican US House primary in Florida. Heavily beaten in the general election, she switched districts in 2022, narrowly losing another primary. Loomer has been closely linked to Nick Fuentes, the white nationalist who, with the rapper Ye, controversially dined with Trump last year. In April, the New York Times reported that the former president wanted to give Loomer a campaign role. It did not come to pass but she remains a vocal supporter. In the video posted online on Sunday, she said she was making her first visit to Bedminster, Trump’s golf club in New Jersey. Sitting with the man she called “the greatest president ever”, she said Trump was “killing it right now” in the Republican presidential primary, adding: “You’re crushing it. You’re up over 50 points.” Trump, 77, said: “It’s great to have you and you are very special and you work hard … I appreciate your support and everybody appreciates your support.” Loomer said: “Thank you so much for inviting me to sit with you today. It’s a pleasure. You’re the best. I love you.” The ex-president is indeed dominating the Republican primary, despite facing 78 criminal charges contained in three separate indictments – for hush-money payments, retention of classified information and election subversion – and the prospect of more, over election subversion, in Georgia this week. On Monday, the fivethirtyeight.com polling average put Trump at 53.7% and his nearest challenger, Ron DeSantis, at 14.3% – a lead of 39.4 points. Aides to the Florida governor are reportedly bullish about his chances in Iowa, the first state to vote next year. But Trump leads there by robust margins too. Despite Trump’s unprecedented legal jeopardy, some party insiders fear that if he is not picked to face the Democratic incumbent Joe Biden, Republican turnout will drop. “There’s concern that if Trump’s not the nominee, his coalition will take their ball and go home,” Matt Dole, an Ohio strategist, told the Hill. Another strategist, Brian Darling, said: “If somehow he’s not the nominee, it will hurt turnout. He’s got a unique coalition. He brings a lot of non-traditional voters to the Republican party.” Trump’s “non-traditional voters” include those on the extreme right. But in April, when Trump reportedly sought to give Loomer a campaign role, another ardent supporter, the far-right Georgia congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, was angry. “Laura Loomer is mentally unstable and a documented liar,” wrote Greene, who has also spread conspiracy theories, including claiming the Parkland shooting was a “false flag” operation. “Never hire or do business with a liar. Liars are toxic and poisonous to everything they touch.” According to the Washington Post, Trump made 30,573 false or misleading claims in his four years in office."

    "title": "Man accused of attacking Paul Pelosi absorbed conspiracy theories, trial hears",
    "content": "The trial of a man accused of breaking into Nancy Pelosi’s San Francisco home and bludgeoning her husband with a hammer has begun, with a defense attorney arguing that her client, David DePape, was caught up in conspiracy theories. Paul Pelosi, who was 82 at the time, was attacked by DePape in the early hours of 28 October last year and hospitalized with a skull fracture and injuries to his right arm and hands. The encounter, which was captured by police body-cam footage, sent shockwaves through the political world just days before last year’s midterm elections.\n\n“There’s too much violence … political violence. Too much hatred, too much vitriol,” Joe Biden said shortly after the attack. “Enough is enough is enough.” The defense attorney Jodi Linker said on Thursday in opening statements in court in San Francisco that she would not dispute that DePape attacked the former House speaker’s husband. Instead, she will argue that DePape believed “with every ounce of his body” he was taking action to stop corruption and the abuse of children by politicians and actors. “This is not a whodunit. But what the government fails to acknowledge is the ‘whydunit’ – and the ‘why’ matters in this case,” Linker said. DePape pleaded not guilty to attempted kidnapping of a federal official and assault on the immediate family member of a federal official with intent to retaliate against the official for performance of their duties. Paul Pelosi is expected to testify next week. The federal prosecutor Laura Vartain Horn told the jurors that DePape started planning the attack in August, and that the evidence and FBI testimony will show he researched his targets online, collecting phone numbers and addresses, even paying for a public records service to find information about Nancy Pelosi and others. During her opening statement, Vartain Horn showed a photo of Paul Pelosi lying in a pool of blood. She also played a call DePape made to a television station repeating conspiracy theories. “The evidence in this case is going show that when the defendant used this hammer to break into the Pelosi’s home he intended to kidnap Nancy Pelosi,” Vartain Horn said, holding a hammer inside a plastic evidence bag. DePape is known to have a history of spreading far-right conspiracy theories, posting rants on a blog and an online forum about aliens, communists, religious minorities and global elites. He questioned the results of the 2020 election and echoed the baseless rightwing QAnon conspiracy theory that claims the US government is run by a cabal of devil-worshipping pedophiles. The websites were taken down shortly after his arrest."

    "title": "‘Fight and die well’: the US conspiracy theorist linked to the Wieambilla shooters ",
    "content": "By his own admission, the US conspiracy theorist Donald Day didn’t have many friends. The 58-year-old spent much of his time online, uploading YouTube videos about the extreme Christian ideology known as “premillennialism”. The videos on his now-deleted channel, which he launched in 2018, mostly only attracted a few hundred views. But the fringe end-of-days religious messages, recorded from a rural town in Arizona, resonated with Gareth and Stacey Train in the Queensland township of Wieambilla. Day, 58, was arrested last week after he was indicted by a grand jury in Tucson, Arizona on two counts of making interstate threats. One of those related to comments posted online in December 2022 allegedly inciting violence in connection with the incident at Wieambilla, in which two police officers and a neighbour were shot dead.\n\n“From January 2022 to February 2023, Day used social media platforms to express a desire to incite violence and threaten a variety of groups and individuals, including law enforcement and government authorities,” the US Attorney’s Office, district of Arizona, alleged in a statement. “Following the killing of two Queensland Police Service officers in December 2022, Day posted a video on YouTube threatening any law enforcement official who came to his residence. “Separately … [it is alleged] Day threatened to kill [World Health Organization director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus] in February 2023 on the video platform BitChute, calling on others to join him.” After Day’s arrest, Federal Bureau of Investigation agents searched his remote property, 30km north of Heber-Overgaard in northern Arizona. In YouTube comments seen by Guardian Australia, Day referred to the Wieambilla shooters, Gareth and Stacey Train, as his “brother” and “sister”. Stacey echoed the warmth between them. “Don … if we could visit in person, the tea and coffee would be strong and the bread would be rich and hearty – just like the conversation,” Stacey told Day. Gareth Train began following Day’s YouTube channel in May 2020. Twelve months later Day began exchanging messages with the couple before they accessed another older account he had created in 2014. In a final video shared by the Trains last year, Stacey told “Don” they would “be home soon” and that they loved him. The chilling video was filmed after the couple, along with Gareth’s brother, Nathaniel Train, had ambushed police officers with a hail of bullets. Constables Rachel McCrow and Matthew Arnold were killed after they had attended the property to perform a welfare check on Nathaniel. A neighbour, Alan Dare, was also killed after coming to investigate a fire that had broken out. Later that evening the Trains were shot dead by police at their rural Wieambilla property. It wasn’t long until the Trains’ final message was uncovered by the media and questions were raised about the identity of “Don”. Days after the Wieambilla attack, Day uploaded two now-deleted YouTube videos about the shootings. In the first he spoke about the couple being “on the run”. “The devils came for them to kill them, and they had to kill the devils themselves,” he said. “My only brother [Gareth Train] that I can find in the last 15, 20 years is in another part of the world and I have no one here.” In another now-deleted video, titled “brother sister martyr”, Day said the couple did exactly what their “heavenly father would have done in the same situation”. Guardian Australia revealed last year that days before the shootout the Trains had also discussed buying “supplies” with Day. “We are happy and keen for the next stage of the journey,” the Trains wrote. “So it begins.” The US Attorney’s Office says Day faces a maximum sentence of five years in prison, a fine of up to $250,000 and up to three years of supervised release on each of the two counts. On Wednesday Guardian Australia uncovered an active social media account which appears to belong to Day. In a comment posted a week ago, the account voices opposition to the proposed construction of windmills in Heber-Overgaard. It also references a conspiracy theory about a “UN agenda 2030” which it says are “designed to displace off-gridders”’. “They will succeed, one way or another ... whether through our consent or the barrel of a gun,” the account writes. “It will take grit and sacrifice to stop the monsters from erecting any more of those damned things; we either go Geronimo on them, or lose all that we have.”"

    "title": "‘Watershed moment’: activists speak out about ‘Cop City’ conspiracy charges",
    "content": "Sixty-one defendants in the largest criminal conspiracy case ever leveled against a protest movement are bracing for the next step in the legal process, unsure if they will soon see the inside of a jail cell. Meanwhile, the Atlanta-based Southern Center for Human Rights is preparing to “face historic prosecution with a historic defense”, said Devin Franklin, movement policy counsel. The organization hopes to raise $12m and is contacting lawyers across the country, said Tiffany Williams Roberts, public policy director.\n\nOn Friday, some lawyers who have already represented defendants received word from the state that warrants would be issued or booking would occur soon, but the process wasn’t spelled out. The importance of the moment was not lost on observers. “It’s no exaggeration to call this a watershed moment in the history of civil liberties in the US,” said Will Potter, author of Green Is the New Red, which details the federal government’s legal campaigns against environmental activists. Nearly all of the group of 61 have been arrested and previously jailed at various times over the last year-plus in relation to opposition against a police and fire department training center known as “Cop City”. They are being charged under Georgia’s Rico law, as laid out in a 109-page indictment released earlier this month – a law usually used against organized crime groups, like the mafia. Elsewhere in Georgia, former US president Donald Trump and others are also facing Rico charges for alleged efforts to change the 2020 election result. Defendants in the Cop City case spoke with the Guardian using their preferred names, from Atlanta and across the country. They had been arrested for acts that included putting flyers on mailboxes and being in a public park in the same forest where the training center is planned. They said the “uncertainty is the terrifying part” of the state’s approach to date. Several opened up about their experiences in jail after being arrested. They described being in solitary confinement, getting called a “terrorist” by prison guards, watching another prisoner die and being asked to strip by a prison doctor to confirm that their transgender identity did not include a sex change operation. The indictment was handed down in Fulton county, the location of “probably the most mismanaged and dangerous jail in the country”, said Franklin. Five people died at the jail in August alone. All those who spoke with the Guardian invoked the solidarity and mutual aid that has characterized the movement as a source of hope in a case that may take years to litigate. Many started online fundraisers to help pay for travel and other expenses tied to the case. Those same ideals are mentioned dozens of times in the indictment – but as evidence, from the state’s point of view, that people opposed to the training center are being offered material and other goods in exchange for remaining “loyal” to a criminal organization. The indictment’s framing was “silly”, said Potter – “but the reality is, in the eyes of the government, these concepts are a threat to state power”. Wisteria, 39, lives in Atlanta and suffers from fibromyalgia and a host of other conditions that make her eligible to receive federal disability benefits. She spoke with the Guardian using a name others in the movement call her out of concern for her family being targeted due to her indictment. She was arrested in May of last year after laying out a blanket in the parking lot of the public park in South River Forest where activities such as teach-ins and concerts have been held since opposition to Cop City began growing in 2021, when Atlanta announced plans for the center. “Forest defenders” also camped in the park until March of this year, when DeKalb county shut it down."

    "title": "Voice pamphlets: false claims and conspiracy theories distributed across Australia",
    "content": "People across Australia are receiving unauthorised pamphlets that make false claims and share conspiracy theories about the Indigenous voice to parliament. Claims of “apartheid” and a United Nations takeover are among the false information promoted by the materials, copies of which have been seen by Guardian Australia. A volunteer for the yes campaign, based in the Bega Valley region in New South Wales and who did not want to be named, said she was approached in early September by a woman who handed her a pamphlet. “Vote no to apartheid”, it reads, referring readers to a handful of websites, including one that shares white supremacist material. Another site linked to a Telegram channel that has posted antisemitic and racist content against the voice. “I think it’s disturbing that people believe in this information,” the volunteer said. “I’m genuinely surprised by some of the perspectives that come through from the community.”\n\nThe pamphlet was unauthorised, but a similar version with an authorisation from “Roobs Flyers”, with a Gold Coast address, is available for download on a website by the same name. Business records show the name is associated with Spencer Chalifour, an anti-voice activist who goes by Roobs. Chalifour told Guardian Australia he made the flyers after he said that he had seen plenty of material that supported a yes vote, but hardly any promoting the no campaign. “I only wanted people to go to that particular article. They don’t have to look at the whole website,” he said. “The same thing applies to all the other links. “Some people might not like it, some people might agree with it. But at the end of the day you’ve got to make up your own mind don’t you?” A July post in a Telegram channel associated with “Roobs Flyers” claimed 40,000 copies of the pamphlets that the volunteer received had been printed and dispatched across Australia. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Chalifour has previously apologised for using an artwork by the Indigenous artist Danny Eastwood without permission on another unauthorised anti-voice flyer. He has since removed Eastwood’s artwork from the pamphlet on his website, and added an authorisation after being contacted by the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC). “We have no control over whether or not someone downloaded that previous version of the flyer and printed it out,” Chalifour said. “It’s not on the website any more.” Under Australian electoral law, print material related to the referendum that aims to influence how people vote must contain authorisation information – typically the name and location of the person or entity distributing the ad or flyer. Guardian Australia’s call out for referendum campaign material has received a range of unauthorised pamphlets that have been put in letterboxes and handed out, many of which make variations of the claim that the voice will lead to people losing “all ownership of land”. Debra, a yes campaign volunteer on the NSW Central Coast who did not want her surname published, found a one-page printout in her mailbox about three weeks ago. The document repeated a conspiracy theory suggesting the UN would take over land if the voice were to pass – a claim that has also spread on TikTok – along with a QR code that linked to a website with videos that made similar claims. She said it was very disturbing to consider it likely came from someone in her area. “That you’ve got neighbours that think about those things [is disturbing],” Debra said. “[I’m] really disappointed and upset at that level of ridiculousness and outrageousness.”"

    "content": "DON’T MENTION THE VAR What the Human Rights World Cup lacks in equality, dignity, human rights and Scotland, it is more than making up for in drama. The last group games have been popcorn-gorging, brain-melting belters, with something for everyone: schadenfreude addicts, conspiracy theorists, historians and permutations junkies. Belgium and Germany went out on Thursday, and for a delirious couple of minutes, in which it was beyond the wit of man to utter anything other than “Oh my God!”, it looked like Spain might join them. Belgium’s exit was on the cards after their defeat to Morocco on Sunday, but nobody saw the manner of it coming. Poor Romelu Lukaku produced a tragi-cameo for the ages, with a personal xG of 1.98 and a G of 0.00. His only shot on target was when he rammed his fist into the dugout after the game. Germany followed Belgium to the airport a few hours later despite beating Costa Rica 4-2. That’s because Japan beat Spain, with a winning goal that, at first glance, seemed to involve the ball going out of play before Kaoru Mitoma cut it back to the goalscorer Ao Tanaka. Everyone shouted “Over the line!” like Walter Sobchak until, a long time after the event, somebody stumbled upon an angle that showed the curvature – don’t pretend you’d ever heard that word before it came out of Peter Walton’s mouth – of the ball may not have been completely over the line. This was not enough for ITV pundit Graeme Souness, who muttered darkly about cover-ups and stopped just short of saying that Fifa was responsible for a psyop called Covid-19. Friday’s matches will decide the last four places in the second round, which begins on Saturday. England play Senegal on Sunday evening, which is bad news for the viewing figures of Countryfile on BBC1 – not to mention Craig Charles: UFO Conspiracies on the History channel, this time with guest presenter Graeme Souness. Before all that, there’s the small matter of Ghana v Uruguay to decide who joins Portugal in the last 16. There’s a small chance that South Korea could finish above them both, but the likelihood is that it’ll be a fight to the death, just like it was in the quarter-final 12 years ago. Luis Suárez, whose handball on the line stopped Ghana becoming the first African team to reach the semi-final, pointedly held court in front of the press on Thursday. The gist of his message was, well: bite me. “I didn’t say sorry because I did the handball but Ghana’s player missed the penalty, not me,” he said. “Maybe I would apologise if I tackled and injured a player but in this situation I took the red card, the referee gave a penalty and it’s not my fault because I didn’t miss the penalty. The player who missed it said he’d do the same. It’s not my responsibility to take the penalty.” The Ghana coach Otto Addo agreed with Suárez, pretty much, but such reason is unlikely to be evident when the game gets going – especially if Suárez again demonstrates his win-at-costs-you-can’t-imagine mentality.

There are cats strolling around and he’s scared of them. It makes everyone laugh” – France’s Randal Kolo Muani is short on sympathy for teammate Ousmane Dembélé, who is apparently struggling to deal with the number of stray felines on the streets of Doha.\n\nFOOTBALL DAILY LETTERS “So, there we were, on a winter sun holiday in Tenerife, and decided last night (of all nights) to go to a lovely restaurant with no TV and no football. Good food, good wine and good chat with Mrs Smith. A romantic evening. On our way there I caught a glimpse in a bar, of the early scores, 1-0 to both Germany and Spain. You’re a genius Mike, the best night not to watch. About an hour later and well into food, wine and chat, my phone receives lots of WhatsApp messages from friends back home in freezing Wiltshire. ‘Hope you’re watching this mayhem, bedlam, carnage, chaos, ridiculousness …’ I then spent 30 minutes or so constantly refreshing the scores. Romance went out the window when I excitedly told Mrs Smith that, at one point, Spain and Germany were going home. All is fine here, we love each other – I’ll make it up to her on Sunday when we get home to freezing Wiltshire. Oh no, it’s England v Senegal” – Mike Smith. “‘Denmark as the HRWC’s biggest disappointment (yesterday’s Football Daily)? Roberto Martínez has entered the chat” – JJ Zucal. “So, like any Football Daily pedant, I was intrigued by your crafty line that the Danish team took ‘flight DO1 to Copenhagen’ (yesterday’s Football Daily) after their poor runout at the HR World Cup. Well, that’ll be a long travel day. ‘DO’ is the international code for Compania Dominicana de Avia. I’ll assume they have a quick layover in the Dominican Republic and be home by nightfall” – Mike Wilner. “Liverpool’s 2,500 new rail seats (yesterday’s Beyond the HRWC) won’t be much use for any fans wanting to travel to Anfield with Avanti West Coast, given they’ll struggle to get a rail seat, rail stand or rail hide-in-the-toilet to get there” – Jim Hearson.

    "title": "Queensland shooting sparking ‘false flag’ conspiracy theories, experts warn",
    "content": "Experts say chilling videos posted by the couple at the centre of the deadly Queensland shooting have sparked conspiracy theories about the tragedy being a “cover-up” or “false flag” event. Conspiracists have spent countless hours on encrypted apps and online forums for more than a week, attempting to present an alternative reality of the shooting that left two officers and a neighbour dead.\n\nSeveral of these theories echo the paranoia and conspiratorial thinking of the shooters – Gareth and Stacey Train and Gareth’s brother Nathaniel, who were later killed in a shootout with police – with some presenting them as victims who “knew too much”. Some have taken note of Nathaniel’s anger at his former employer, the New South Wales education department, while others have falsely claimed the Trains were killed because the government and gas industry wanted to access their property for fracking. Elise Thomas, a senior online data analyst at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, said when a violent event involves conspiracy theorists, there is regularly an immediate “shying away from the uncomfortable truth”. “To realise that, actually, some of the people they’ve been communicating with are quite violent and very, very strange people – who they would probably cross the street to avoid in person – I think that is a bit of a shock to the system,” Thomas said. “These conspiracy theories help explain away that uncomfortable feeling [of] ‘What have I gotten myself into here?’” Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Stacey and Gareth Train uploaded a video on the night of the shootings claiming to have killed “demons and devils” on their property. Many of their other videos expressed an intense hatred towards police and include references to evangelical apocalypticism and conspiracy theories. Despite this, some conspiracists have rejected the video entirely, claiming it is a “deep fake” engineered by state actors and authorities. Deakin University senior research fellow Dr Josh Roose said the nature of conspiratorial thinking is that everything is folded into a grand conspiracy, with these types of theories taking on a life of their own. “People will sit there and look at what was said, what was done and will weave that into their own narrative and then spread their narrative. Then someone else will take that narrative and build upon it,” Roose said. “It gets to the point where there’s no clarity and everything is a conspiracy.” Roose said conspiracy theorists often attempt to show a type of “alternate truth and mobilise other like-minded actors to work against whatever dominant power they see”. The researcher said tackling these beliefs can be challenging, particularly when events are subject to investigation and there is an absence of facts about what has occurred."

    "title": "First Thing: Oath Keepers founder guilty of seditious conspiracy",
    "content": "Good morning. Stewart Rhodes, the founder of the rightwing Oath Keepers militia, has been found guilty of seditious conspiracy, a charge arising from the attack on the US Capitol by supporters of Donald Trump. Rhodes and his co-defendant Kelly Meggs are the first people in nearly three decades to be found guilty of the rarely used civil war-era charge at trial. The trial was the biggest test yet for the Department of Justice in its efforts to hold accountable those responsible for the attack that shook the foundations of US democracy. Rhodes is a Yale Law-educated former paratrooper and disbarred attorney. In an eight-week trial, he and four associates were accused of fomenting a plot to use force to stop Congress from certifying Joe Biden’s 2020 election victory. How significant is the case? Harry Litman, a former US attorney turned legal analyst, said the guilty verdicts represented “a huge, huge victory for the [justice department] in a challenging and deeply important, even historic, case”. US Senate passes bill protecting same-sex marriage\n\nThe Senate has passed the Respect for Marriage Act, legislation to protect same-sex unions that Democrats are hurrying to get to Joe Biden to be signed into law before Republicans take over the House next year. Nearly 50 House Republicans supported the measure earlier this year. In the Senate, support from 12 Republicans was enough to override the filibuster and advance the bill to yesterday’s majority vote, which ended 61-36. Although the Respect for Marriage Act would not codify Obergefell v Hodges, the 2015 supreme court decision that made same-sex marriage legal nationwide, it would require states to recognise all marriages that were legal when performed, including in other states. Same-sex marriage has been thought to be under threat since June, when the conservative-dominated supreme court struck down the right to abortion. Then, the hardline justice Clarence Thomas wrote that other privacy-based rights, including same-sex marriage, could be reconsidered next. Public support for same-sex marriage is at an all-time high of about 70%. But according to the Movement Advancement Project, an LGBTQ+ advocacy group, if the supreme court did overturn the right, at least 29 states would be able to enforce bans.

    "title": "Oath Keepers founder Stewart Rhodes found guilty of seditious conspiracy",
    "content": "Stewart Rhodes, the founder of the rightwing Oath Keepers militia, has been found guilty of seditious conspiracy, a charge arising from the January 6 attack on the US Capitol by supporters of Donald Trump.\n\nWith the verdicts on Tuesday, Rhodes and his co-defendant Kelly Meggs became the first people in nearly three decades to be found guilty of the rarely used, civil war-era charge at trial. Three other Oath Keepers members have pleaded guilty to seditious conspiracy. But the last time the US justice department secured such a conviction at trial was in the 1995 prosecution of Islamic militants who plotted to bomb landmarks in New York City. It was the biggest test yet for the justice department in its efforts to hold accountable those responsible for the attack that shook the foundations of US democracy. Harry Litman, a former US attorney turned legal analyst, said the guilty verdicts represented “a huge huge victory for the US [justice department] in a challenging and deeply important, even historic, case”. Rhodes is a Yale-educated former paratrooper and disbarred attorney. In an eight-week trial, he and four associates were accused of fomenting a plot to use force to stop Congress from certifying Joe Biden’s 2020 election victory. The Capitol riot of 6 January 2021 has been linked to nine deaths including suicides among law enforcement officers. A US district judge, Amit Mehta, presided over the Oath Keepers trial. The 12-member jury deliberated for three days. Rhodes’s four co-defendants were Meggs, Kenneth Harrelson, Jessica Watkins and Thomas Caldwell. Meggs was convicted of seditious conspiracy. Harrelson, Caldwell and Watkins were acquitted. Watkins admitted impeding police officers, and apologized. All five defendants were convicted of obstruction of an official proceeding, with mixed verdicts on a handful of other charges. Rhodes was acquitted of two other conspiracy charges. Rhodes intends to appeal, the defense attorney James Lee Bright told reporters. Another Rhodes lawyer, Ed Tarpley, described the verdict as a “mixed bag”, adding: “This is not a total victory for the government in any way, shape or form.” Tarpley added: “We feel like we presented a case that showed through evidence and testimony that Mr Rhodes did not commit the crime of seditious conspiracy.” Rhodes, who wears an eye patch after accidentally shooting himself in the face, was one of the most prominent defendants of about 900 charged in connection with the Capitol attack. He founded the Oath Keepers, whose members include current and retired military personnel, law enforcement officers and first responders, in 2009. Members have showed up, often heavily armed, at protests and political events including demonstrations following the May 2020 murder of George Floyd by a white police officer in Minneapolis. Prosecutors said Rhodes and his co-defendants planned to use force to stop Congress from certifying Biden’s win. Rhodes did not go inside the Capitol but was accused of leading the plot. Through recordings and encrypted messages, jurors heard how he rallied followers to fight to keep Trump in office, warned of a “bloody” civil war and expressed regret that the Oath Keepers did not bring rifles. Meggs, Watkins and Harrelson entered the Capitol wearing tactical gear. The defendants were accused of creating a “quick reaction force” positioned at a Virginia hotel and equipped with firearms that could be quickly transported to Washington. Fifty witnesses testified. Rhodes and two others testified in their own defense. They denied plotting an attack or seeking to stop Congress from certifying results. Rhodes insisted that those who went inside went rogue. Prosecutors sought to paint Rhodes as a liar, showing him his own text messages, videos, photos and recordings. These included Rhodes saying he could have hanged the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, from a lamppost. Watkins, who fled the US army, and Caldwell, a disabled navy veteran, were the others who chose to testify. Watkins admitted “criminal liability” for impeding officers inside the Capitol but denied any plan to storm the building, instead describing being “swept up” in the moment, as shoppers behave when they rush into stores to purchase discounted holiday gifts. Caldwell, who like Rhodes did not enter the Capitol, never formally joined the Oath Keepers. He tried to downplay texts he sent in connection with the attack, saying some lines were adapted from or inspired by The Princess Bride or Bugs Bunny. Four other Oath Keepers members charged with seditious conspiracy are due to go to trial in December. Members of another rightwing group, the Proud Boys, including its former chairman Enrique Tarrio, also are due for trial on seditious conspiracy charges. • This article was amended on 30 November 2022 to remove some personal information."

    "title": "Reichsbürger: the German conspiracy theorists at heart of alleged coup plot",
    "content": "At 6am on Wednesday, German special forces stormed a house in the Berlin lakeside villa quarter of Wannsee and arrested a former MP of the far-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD), Birgit Malsack-Winkemann. Three minutes later, they entered the Waidmannsheil hunting lodge in Bad Lobenstein in Thuringia. Simultaneous raids took place in 30 other locations, including a car repair shop and a carpenters’ studio, as well as in the Austrian ski resort of Kitzbühel and the Italian city of Perugia. Twenty-five people were arrested, and by lunchtime eight of them were in police custody, among them a serving soldier of the elite KSK unit, a lawyer, a pilot, a gourmet chef and a prince, the alleged ringleader who had led the plans to overthrow the German state and replace it with a “monarchistic order”.\n\nIt was, said one MP from the leftwing Linke party, like something out of a crime novel. Other comparisons were made with the hit TV series Babylon Berlin, set in the German capital in the heady days of the Weimar era, when democracy is on the brink of collapse and violent clashes abound between extralegal paramilitary formations. But despite the description of its alleged members by prosecutors as a “motley crew” of unlikely characters, the plot was real. So were the weapons they owned, the gun licences they held and the fact that among them were serving members of the police and military. The most dominant among the group of what the state prosecutors called a “conglomerate of conspiracy theorists” were the Reichsbürger, who believe the German state is an artificial construct that illegitimately replaced the “Deutsche Reich” of the Nazi era. Though little known outside the country until now, they have become increasingly familiar to Germans in recent years, not least following various thwarted plots, including that of a 75-year-old retired teacher in October. Peter Frank, Germany’s chief prosecutor, had warned this summer of a radicalisation of the rightwing milieu, pointing specifically at the Reichsbürger who, he said, together with conspiracy theorists, were becoming “increasingly ready to use violence”. He added: “It would be careless to shrug the danger off.” Those who count themselves among the Reichsbürger reject the idea of the modern German state by refusing to pay their taxes and are frequently in dispute with the authorities as a result. Some refer to themselves as “Selbstverwalter” or self-governed."

    "title": "Trump accused of ‘multi-part conspiracy’ by January 6 panel | First Thing",
    "content": "Good morning. The congressional panel investigating the January 6 attack on the US Capitol has published its final report, accusing Donald Trump of a “multi-part conspiracy” to thwart the will of the people and subvert democracy. Divided into eight chapters, the 845-page report includes findings, interview transcripts and legislative recommendations and represents one of the most damning official portraits of a president in American history. Its release comes three days after the select committee recommended criminal charges against Trump and follows media reports that it is cooperating and sharing crucial evidence with the justice department. The panel, which will dissolve on 3 January when Republicans take control of the House of Representatives, conducted more than 1,000 interviews, held 10 public hearings – some televised in prime time – and collected more than 1m documents since forming in July last year. What are the findings of the report? The report included 17 key findings. Among them it concluded that, beginning on election night and continuing through 6 January and thereafter, Trump disseminated false allegations of fraud related to the 2020 presidential election in order to aid his effort to overturn the election. What has Trump said in response? The ex-president has condemned the House committee as “thugs and scoundrels”. In response to the criminal referrals, he said: “These folks don’t get it that when they come after me, people who love freedom rally around me. It strengthens me.” What else is happening in government? The US Senate passed a $1.7tn government spending bill, sending it to the House to approve and send to Joe Biden for his signature, averting a partial government shutdown. Potential bomb cyclone is ‘serious stuff’, Biden warns as Arctic blast looms\n\nThousands of flights have been cancelled after US forecasters warned yesterday of “potentially crippling impacts across central and eastern” parts of the country, producing widespread disruption to travel and utilities over the holiday season, as an arctic blast surged from west to east. At the White House, after a briefing on the potential “bomb cyclone”, Joe Biden said: “This is not like a snow day when you were a kid. This is serious stuff.” A bomb cyclone forms when atmospheric pressure drops very quickly in a strong storm. Forecasters expected that to occur near the Great Lakes, increasing winds and creating blizzard conditions. About 200 million people in the lower 48 states were under extreme weather alerts, said Bob Oravec, a forecaster with the National Weather Service in College Park, Maryland. At least 4,400 flights have been cancelled, according to Reuters, disrupting holiday plans across the country. An NWS advisory said the “powerful winter storm” would “produce widespread disruptive and potentially crippling impacts across the central and eastern United States”. What does the forecast say? According to the NWS, the “major and anomalous storm system” was expected to produce “a multitude of weather hazards through early this weekend”, including “heavy snowfall, strong winds and dangerously cold temperatures. At the forefront of the impressive weather pattern is a dangerous and record-breaking cold air mass in the wake of a strong Arctic cold front diving southward.” North Korea denies supplying Russia’s Wagner Group with weapons"

    "title": "Berhalter denies Gio Reyna conspiracy claims as USA-Iran match approaches",
    "content": "Any hopes that Gregg Berhalter’s United States team could stick to sports on the eve of their win-or-go-home game against Iran at the World Cup were dramatically swept aside on Monday when the thorny geopolitical underpinnings of the match exploded to the fore during a tense half-hour news conference. But even as Berhalter parried a series of provocative questions from Iranian media invoking US immigration policy, inflation rates and school shootings, and the 23-year-old squad captain Tyler Adams was called upon to answer for America’s centuries-old legacy of inequality and racial discrimination, both men remained laser-focused on the task at hand. The United States need a victory on Tuesday night at the Al Thumama Stadium to reach the knockout stage and extend their first World Cup appearance after an eight-year absence. That it happens to be a rematch of one of the most politically charged matches in World Cup history is beside the point. “I know that a lot of other constituents have another feeling towards it, but for us it’s a soccer game against a good team and it’s not much more than that,” Berhalter said. “It’s a knockout game. Both teams want to go to the next round, both teams are desperate to go to the next round, and that’s how we’re looking at this match. We’re very focused on what we could do as a team, as are they, and we think it’s gonna be a good soccer game.”\n\nBerhalter also was pressed on the biggest non-political controversy around his team: the recent claim by former US international Eric Wynalda that Gio Reyna’s limited action in Qatar is due to a “rift” with the manager. Reyna, the 20-year-old Borussia Dortmund winger and one of the US team’s most promising young talents, played seven minutes against England as a late substitute after being left out of the team entirely against Wales. Berhalter has told reporters that Reyna’s abbreviated minutes are due to “tightness”, while Reyna has claimed he is fully fit and ready to go. Those crossed signals came under a harsh glare on Friday when Wynalda, who played for the national team from 1990 through 2000 and retired as the program’s all-time leading goalscorer, said Berhalter is not telling the truth and the situation is causing “internal strife” within the team. He also stated that he had spoken with Gio’s father Claudio, the former US captain and Berhalter’s childhood friend and ex-teammate. On Monday, Berhalter denied Wynalda’s claim of a conspiracy, saying: “That’s just not who I am.” “Speaking of the four-year journey, there’s been also four years of interacting with you guys [the US media], and what I’d say is: I’ll leave it to you to decide if I asked Gio to lie about it,” Berhalter said. “That’s just not who I am. That’s not what I represent. So if you have to take Eric’s word or my word or whatever, feel free, but I know what happened and that’s not what I represent. Like every other person, Gio is a member of this team that we care deeply for and we know can help the team. It’s a matter of when he can help us and how he can help us.” The biggest question surrounding the US team’s prospects on Tuesday remains their ability to finish chances. Their glaring lack of goalscoring from the No 9 position was a persistent issue throughout qualifying and there’s been little progress thus far in Qatar, where they have broken through just once in 180 minutes. “We talked about this last time, especially after the [England] game when I said how difficult goals are in the World Cup,” Berhalter said. “It’s hard to come by goals, and that’s what we’ve found. For us, it’s about how we put our players in a position to create chances. “We’ve been defending really well and that keeps you in games. We know in this game, we’re going to need to score a goal. That’s going to have to happen, so we stay calm. We have a plan and we’ll go out and try to execute that plan.” So far Berhalter’s choices at central striker have been Norwich City’s Josh Sargent against Wales and the surprise roster inclusion Haji Wright, whose high-energy press of England’s back line on Friday flummoxed their effort to build out of the back. “I think [the US strikers have] been OK,” Berhalter said, while refusing to tip his hand for Tuesday’s choice. “When we’re evaluating the performance in the first game, Josh had a good chance at the near post and, looking at the second game, Haji was very effective on the defensive end of the game, had some good runs into the channel, very lively. Perhaps there were a couple of times when we could have been more effective with the movement in the penalty box.” Adding to the Americans’ anxiety is the fact that Iran need only a win or a draw to advance – and reach the knockout stage for the first time in six World Cup appearances – giving them an incentive to pack players behind the ball and dare the US to break them down. But Adams, for his part, doesn’t believe that’s a concern. “After watching Iran’s last game, I would not expect them to do that because they went after the game and they were looking for three points,” Adams said. “You could tell from the mentality of the group. They were attacking, counter-attacking, doing everything they needed to do, fighting in every single duel, [making] tackles. Every single moment of the game looked like it could be their moment to score a goal.” Asked whether he felt a win against Iran was necessary to validate the US team’s progress from their catastrophic failure to qualify for the World Cup four years ago, Adams, who is the youngest captain in Qatar, was to the point. “We have to get out of our group by all means,” he said. “It’s good going into a game knowing there’s only one way to do it, so you’ve got to go after it. It would feel like a success for us when we make it out of the group and then continue on in the tournament.”"

    "title": "Inside the unhinged midterm election conspiracy theories on Truth Social ",
    "content": "Ballot boxes being stuffed. “BlueAnon”. Men in underpants. Every Democratic candidate: a “complete weirdo psychopath”. To dive into Truth Social, Donald Trump’s Twitter-but-for-conspiracy-theorists social media platform, is to enter a world where all of the above are real topics of debate, breathlessly discussed by Trump-backing Republicans and anonymous rightwing provocateurs.\n\nTruth Social has always been a platform for lies and obfuscations; about the 2020 election, the Democratic party, vaccines, Hunter Biden. But with less than a week before the election, the platform and its users have become even more unhinged. The site, formed as Trump’s alternative to Twitter after he was banned from that platform in the wake of the January 6 insurrection, is awash with false theories about how the Democratic party is attempting to manipulate the midterm vote, false claims about the attack on Paul Pelosi, Nancy Pelosi’s husband, and false accusations about Democratic candidates themselves. As one of the most followed Truth Social users, Donald Trump Jr, son of the former US president, has been one of the most prominent agitators. In the run-up to the election, Trump Jr has used the platform to echo rightwing talking points about vaccines, drugs, Ukraine and a host of other issues. His posts are eagerly lapped up by fellow Truthers, and he isn’t the only thought leader on the platform. The unusually named Catturd2 has emerged as one of Truth Social’s tastemakers since the site launched, and with more than 760,000 followers – Kevin McCarthy, the Republican House minority speaker has only 54,000 and Rudy Giuliani, Trump’s on-off friend and lawyer, has 89,000 – when Catturd2 speaks, people listen. In recent days Catturd2 has mostly chosen to speak about the attack on Paul Pelosi, the husband of the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi. Like numerous other Truth Social users, Catturd2 has their doubts and has echoed a rightwing, homophobic, incorrect conspiracy theory about the attack – an idea Trump Jr also peddled on Truth Social. But Catturd2 has other thoughts, too, including on the Democrats running for election in the midterm elections. “Every single Democrat candidate is a complete weirdo psychopath,” Catturd2 wrote recently, in a truth that was liked by more than 6,000 accounts, and which largely captures the attitude of Truth Social users toward Democratic politicians and their supporters. Truth Social launched, chaotically, in February 2022. Billed as “a major new platform” where Republicans and Democrats alike could converse in an environment free from the “censorship” of big tech – an environment with an “ironclad commitment to protecting vigorous debate” – thousands of would-be users were unable to access the service for weeks, and Trump himself was said to be furious with the platform. Trump had planned a $1.3bn merger of Truth Social with Digital World Acquisition Corp, a blank check company, but the deal has been plagued by delays and is under federal investigation. In October it emerged that the co-founder of Trump’s social media company had told the US Securities and Exchange Commission that the company’s efforts to raise $1bn were based on “fraudulent misrepresentations … in violation of federal securities laws”. Still, Truth Social has managed to grow in popularity, with its number of users surging past other rightwing platforms like Gab, Parler and Gettr. Even if Truth Social’s 1.7m US unique visitors a month is dwarfed by Twitter and Facebook, it has become the go-to meeting place for Trump supporters to voice unsubstantiated concerns about voter fraud. As the election looms, ballot “drop boxes” have become the particular bete noire for the rightwing crowd. Introduced so that people can drop off their early voting or absentee ballots, to Truth Social users these drop boxes are nothing more than election fraud in plain sight – flimsy, poorly guarded containers where Democratic backers or members of the deep state regularly stop off to jam hundreds of fraudulent ballots into the counting system. On Truth Social, people have been called to action. “Get out and help patriots. Watch those ballot drop boxes. We can’t let them steal another election,” msannthrope wrote, in a post similar to hundreds of others on the platform. In fact, on Tuesday a judge issued a restraining order against a rightwing group in Arizona which had deployed people to watch over drop boxes, after accusations of voter intimidation, but the obsession with the boxes hasn’t gone away. Thousands of users posted a link this week to a story from a rightwing website which alleged irregularities at ballot drop boxes in Pennsylvania, a state which Trump and his supporters have accused of seeing fraud in 2020. Politifact, a non-partisan fact-checking website, reported that people had “successfully inserted 18 ballots into three of the eight ballot drop boxes in Centre County, Pennsylvania, before the official window of time when the boxes were open to receive ballots”. But, Politifact wrote: “The ballots are not evidence of fraud. The voters simply didn’t follow directions,” while Michael Pipe, the county’s commission chair and chair of its election board, told local news station KDKA-TV. The ballots will not count towards the Pennsylvania vote, Pipe said, because they were returned incorrectly. If misinformation is king on Truth Social, then that might explain how Marjorie Taylor Greene, a darling of the Trump-Republican movement who is known for both extremism and incompetence, has become one of the loudest voices in what is a very loud room. Throughout October, her account has been a flurry of vague assertions about the Democratic party: half-baked off ideas and theories tossed off apropos of nothing, without explanation or justification. “There are more Democrat conspiracy theories & theorists on Twitter than Qanon ever produced,” Taylor Greene wrote on October 28. “Most have blue check marks, post their pronouns, support war in Ukraine, are triple vaxxed & boosted, and work in corporate media, Hollywood, or the government. “Blueanon [an apparent play on the rightwing QAnon conspiracy theory] is dangerous.” It wasn’t clear – because she didn’t say – what had set Taylor Greene off. But she clearly enjoyed this foreboding, dystopian style, because the next day, she was back at it. “Corporate communists control the speech of their employees & customers by only allowing Democrat speech and punishing, silencing, and canceling Republican speech,” Taylor Greene said. If it was unclear how the concept of a corporate communist would actually work, then it was also unclear what Taylor Greene meant by her grimly threatening follow up: “But there is a shift beginning,” she wrote. “People are beginning to refuse to be silenced and a Patriot economy is beginning.” Perhaps the real motivation for these posts is simply that people on Truth Social love stuff like this. Truth Social is, according to its bosses, a platform where anyone is free to say whatever they want, but what they mostly want to say is that they don’t have anywhere to speak. “Why are people being censored for misleading or false information and not the biggest offenders, the media?” user mikesonfire pondered obliquely this month. Mikesonfire’s other posts have included a suggestion that the military, not “biased clerks” count votes, and that: “Russia invaded the Ukraine to stop the NWO [New World Order, a conspiracy theory which states a cabal of elites is striving for a world government] for producing more viral weapons”. Russia has been a particular fascination for Truth Social users, many of whom have spoken sympathetically about the country and its invasion of Ukraine. Other users have posted approvingly about a Russian government plan to ban people from suggesting homosexual relationships are “normal”, and the hashtag IStandWithRussia has been used repeatedly over the past month. In recent days, despite users’ apparent satisfaction with Truth Social, the main interest has been Elon Musk’s takeover of Twitter, and how it might impact the Democratic party in elections and beyond. Musk’s vague promise to overturn Twitter bans has had people giddy with excitement, claiming it could open the door to a glorious era of Republican reign. “Democrats are not going to be able to handle free speech and the corrupt Democratic Party will fall apart after hearing the truth,” one Truth Social user gravely intoned after Musk purchased Twitter. Another posted: “3 PATRIOTS🇺🇸 TRUMP, MUSK, & [Steve] BANNON,” above a photoshopped picture of the three men. Others “truthed” photos of Musk entering the Twitter HQ, and reveled in the departure of Twitter employees. Troublingly for Trump and Truth Social, however, the most striking response from Truth Social users was the large number of them pleading with Musk to be allowed to return to Twitter. For now, Truth Social might be the platform of choice for those loyal to Trump and his election lies, but it seems large numbers of the platform can’t wait to get away."

    "title": "Elon Musk rules out conspiracy theorist Alex Jones’s return to Twitter",
    "content": "Elon Musk has said he will not reinstate the conspiracy theorist Alex Jones on Twitter, saying he has “no mercy” for people who capitalize on the deaths of children for personal fame. Twitter permanently suspended the accounts of Jones and his Infowars website in September 2018 for violating the platform’s abusive behavior policy.\n\nJones, 48, gained notoriety for pushing a false conspiracy theory about the Sandy Hook elementary school shooting in 2012, which led to harassment of parents who lost their children in the massacre. Jones has been ordered by a US court to pay more than $1.4bn (£1.2bn) to people who suffered from his false claim that the shooting, in which 20 children and six educators died, was a hoax. Musk appeared to rule out a return for Jones in an interaction with Twitter users on Monday. The author and podcaster Sam Harris asked Twitter’s new owner if it was “time to let Alex Jones back on Twitter” and “if not, why not?”. Kim Dotcom, the internet entrepreneur, also asked if Jones could be reinstated in the interest of “real free speech”. Musk replied that he had lost a child – to sudden infant death syndrome in 2002 – and said Jones used the death of children to push his own agenda. He tweeted: “My firstborn child died in my arms. I felt his last heartbeat. I have no mercy for anyone who would use the deaths of children for gain, politics or fame.” Musk has started reinstating previously banned accounts on the platform and lifted the permanent suspension on the account of the former US president Donald Trump on Sunday after conducting a Twitter poll. The Canadian psychologist Jordan Peterson has also been reinstated, along with the British-US former kickboxer Andrew Tate, who had previously been banned for citing extreme misogynistic views, and Project Veritas, a rightwing US organization that specialises in stings against liberal groups and the established media. On Sunday, the US rapper Ye – formerly Kanye West – tweeted the Hebrew greeting shalom, having been allowed access to his account six weeks after it was locked after the announced that he was going “death con 3 On JEWISH PEOPLE”. And on Monday, it appeared that the personal account of Marjorie Taylor Greene, the US congresswoman and rightwing extremist, had also been reinstated. Greene, a frequent promoter of conspiracy theories, was suspended in January for violating Twitter’s policies on Covid misinformation. Greene celebrated the move on her congressional account by attacking “unelected big tech” and tweeting: “My account is back. Go follow @mtgreenee for MTG unfiltered ;)”. Before the wave of reinstatements in recent days, Musk had said there would be no change to the status of banned accounts until a newly announced “content moderation council” had met. He had later added that no bans would be lifted until there was a “clear process for doing so”. However, Musk announced at the weekend that he would reinstate Trump after hosting a poll on his own account in which a slim majority of users called for the ban to be lifted. As of Monday morning, Trump’s live account had more than 87 million followers – close to its pre-ban peak – but he had not tweeted on it, having said at the weekend that he didn’t see “any reason” for returning to the platform. Leading advertisers have paused spending on Twitter owing to concerns about moderation standards on the platform after Musk’s $44bn takeover last month. Their concerns have been compounded by a wave of fake “verified” accounts after Musk offered a blue tick to users – which verifies who they are – for $7.99 a month as part of a relaunch of Twitter’s premium service, which has since been halted. The pharmaceutical firm Eli Lilly was among the businesses hit by hoax accounts after the changes to the Twitter Blue service."

    "title": "Rust shooting: prosecutor rejects conspiracy theory of sabotage plot",
    "content": "The prosecutor investigating the fatal shooting on the Rust film set in New Mexico last month has rejected conspiracy theories launched by defense attorneys of crew members suggesting that the death of the cinematographer could have been the result of a mysterious sabotage plot. “We do not have any proof,” the Santa Fe county district attorney, Mary Carmack-Altwies, told ABC News in an interview broadcast on Wednesday morning. “Do you believe sabotage is a possibility?” a reporter asked, to which Carmack-Altwies firmly replied: “No.” The tragedy occurred on a desert western film set in New Mexico when the actor Alec Baldwin, also a producer on the project, unwittingly fired a loaded gun while rehearsing a scene and the shot killed the cinematographer, Halyna Hutchins, and injured the director, Joel Souza, who was standing behind her. Baldwin was handed a weapon by the assistant director, Dave Halls, who indicated it was “cold” or safe to use, court documents have stated. Police have been investigating the shooting in conjunction with Carmack-Altwies’ office and the tragedy has also sparked fierce debate in Hollywood about working conditions for crew on TV and film sets.\n\nCarmack-Altwies said that if it were to be found that someone did indeed sabotage the film set, then her office would be looking at “certainly a higher level of murder charge than we would potentially be looking at with the facts we have now”. Last week, Jason Bowles, attorney of the set’s 24-year-old weapons armorer Hannah Gutierrez Reed, said someone may have sabotaged the film set, noting: “I believe that somebody who would do that would want to sabotage the set, want to prove a point, want to say they’re disgruntled, they’re unhappy.” He added: “We know there was a live round in a box of dummy rounds that shouldn’t have been there … We have a time frame … in which the firearms at times were unattended, so there was opportunity to tamper with this scene.” Carmack-Altwies raised concerns with “many levels of failures” on the movie set, adding that it was her understanding that more than one live round was found on set, without disclosing the exact number. “We still don’t know how they got on the set and how they got there I think will be one of the most important factors going into a [criminal] charging decision,” she said. Carmack-Altwies also confirmed that she knew the identity of the person who loaded the gun but refused to provide details. Additionally, she contested claims made by Lisa Torraco, attorney for the assistant director, who said that Halls did not take the gun from the prop cart and hand it to Baldwin. “Yes, that does seem to be the case,” Carmack-Altwies said in response to whether it is her belief that Halls handed the pistol to the actor. Since the shooting, New Mexico film industry workers have been demanding better film training and tougher gun regulations on production sets. A dozen producers, set managers, crew members and actors interviewed by Reuters said the industry growth has vastly outstripped the state’s supply of trained crew, putting set safety at risk. Up to a third of staff in some departments on high-budget productions can be inexperienced or on their first movie, according to a senior crew member and two set managers. Lower-budget productions such as Rust scramble to find trained staff as large companies such as Netflix and Universal, both with New Mexico production hubs, hire crews of up to 300, two producers said. New Mexico demands no special training or permits for armorers to manage real firearms."

    "title": "Old Parliament House fire protesters linked to anti-vaccine and conspiracy groups",
    "content": "Leaders of a group of protesters who set fire to the facade of Old Parliament House in Canberra are closely linked to a complex network of anti-vaccination and conspiracy groups which have been accused of spreading misinformation in Indigenous communities during the Covid-19 pandemic. The fire, which broke out during a protest at the entrance to the building on Thursday, caused extensive damage to the doors and portico. There have been a series of demonstrations by Indigenous groups as well as elements of the anti-vaccination movement and sovereign citizen groups at Old Parliament House over the past days. On 22 December another fire was lit at the entrance by the same group of protesters. A protester posted video of that fire on Instagram with the caption: “These Doors are Coming Down Either Way”. Among the protesters are Indigenous land rights activists, anti-vaccine groups and so-called sovereign citizens. The latter is a fringe conspiracy group rooted in antisemitism and organised around a haphazard collection of pseudo-legal beliefs broadly grouped around the notion that modern government is an illegitimate corporation. Like many other threads of conspiratorial thinking, sovereign citizens have enjoyed a confused renaissance during the pandemic. When footage began emerging during the early stages of Covid-19 of people asking police bizarre questions at border stops or describing themselves as a “a living woman” to Bunnings employees, it was largely as a result of sovereign citizen-inflected beliefs. Before the fire on Friday, a piece of paper was taped to a door at Old Parliament House labelled a “notice of acquiescence by default”. It was addressed to, among others, “The Australian Commonwealth de facto Corporate Administration” and contained a garbled set of legalese mirroring sovereign citizen beliefs. Intertwined with the protesters were various fringe anti-vaccination groups as well as members of the “freedom movement” which has pushed anti-lockdown protests during the Covid-19 pandemic before morphing into a catch-all conspiracy movement. Attempts by elements of the conspiracy movement to influence Indigenous groups have been well documented. As the Age has previously reported, some of those movements have been active in promoting misinformation in remote Indigenous communities. In September the Guardian revealed a group had attempted to push ivermectin into the remote regional town of Wilcannia during a Covid outbreak there. There is no evidence that ivermectin has any beneficial effect as a Covid treatment, and it may be harmful in some circumstances. Leaders of the Aboriginal Tent Embassy, established in 1972, condemned the actions that led to Thursday’s fire.\n\n“The actions of such protestors conducting a ‘smoking ceremony’ was done so without the knowledge, consent or mandate of the embassy council and traditional owners responsible for the regulation of the Aboriginal Tent Embassy,” it said in a statement. There were claims following the fire that it may have been the result of a smoking ceremony that got out of hand, or as a result of police using pepper spray to disperse the crowd. However, footage on social media showed that the fire was well lit before police arrived at the scene, and ACT police told the Age the pepper spray used was water-based and did not contain an accelerant. Footage taken by protesters themselves shows many of them celebrating after the fire began to engulf the front of the building. The protests were widely condemned by political leaders. Scott Morrison said it was “disgraceful”. “I’m disgusted and appalled by the behaviour that would see Australians come and set fire to such a symbol of democracy in this country,” the prime minister said on Thursday. But the Greens senator Lidia Thorpe, the party’s first Indigenous representative, wrote on Twitter: “Seems like the colonial system is burning down.

    "title": "Astroworld disaster fuels wave of satanic conspiracy theories on TikTok",
    "content": "Videos of the Astroworld crowd crush that killed eight people flooded TikTok over the weekend. But conspiracy theories have also flourished alongside the graphic footage, accusing the rapper Travis Scott, who founded and performed at the festival, of orchestrating a massive satanic ritual. “This ain’t a festival, it’s a sacrifice,” reads one typical comment. “The music industry is demonic and collects souls,” reads another comment with 34,000 likes. Despite its absurdity, the theory has steadily gained traction – with phrases such as “astroworld demonic”, “astroworld illuminati” and “astroworld upside down cross” trending among other AstroWorld content on the platform. Experts say the viral misinformation illustrates how young social media users are increasingly susceptible to fringe conspiracy theories, despite their reputation as savvy “digital natives”.\n\n“We have this stereotype of conspiracy theorists being older people on social media, but young people can in some ways be more susceptible,” said Jennifer Stromer-Galley, a professor studying social media platforms at Syracuse University. “We know that human brains really like sensational content, and teenage brains even more so because they are still developing,” she added. Internet users have seized on several far-fetched “symbols” present at the concert, including imagery of flames and burning doves. Some TikTok users described the stage as “an inverted cross leading to hell”. Others cited numerology, falsely claiming that Travis Scott and his fellow performer Drake “were born 66 months 6 days apart”. Joseph Russo, who teaches a class on the anthropology of conspiracy theories at Wesleyan University, said such wild claims bore links to QAnon, a conspiracy theory that claims a secret cabal of pedophiles controls the government and is trafficking children. “It is mutating and taking different forms, but it goes back to the idea there is a shadowy group of people in control behind it all,” Russo said. “It is super seductive, and always comes back – but it is surprising young people are following this script more and more.” Gen Z – the name for the generation born after 1996 – faces a number of risk factors for misinformation. It has far higher rates of mistrust in traditional institutions such as the news media and the government compared with past generations and uses social media to get its news coverage at much higher rates than its counterparts."

    "title": "Epstein’s dark legend wraps Maxwell trial in web of conspiracy theories",
    "content": "The graphic testimony presented to jurors in Ghislaine Maxwell’s criminal sex abuse trial last week seemed at times to mesh and then detach from broader theories – criminal, conspiratorial or both – about the nature of Jeffrey Epstein’s world. Whether prosecutors and defense attorneys are successful in separating criminal conspiracy from the conspiracy theories that run through the entire Epstein-Maxwell narrative may determine how the criminal complaint against the 59-year-old former British socialite is ultimately resolved. For the prosecution, their case against Maxwell is to separate the criminal charges she faces from broader conspiracy theories about wealth and power that envelop the dark legend of disgraced financier and sex trafficker Epstein. For Maxwell’s defense, the task may be to entangle Maxwell so deeply in Epstein’s shadow that jurors are simply unable to find her guilty. Both sides are battling preconceptions about wealth, power, privilege and sex – and where those spin off into the sort of conspiracies that have no place in this trial or, arguably, in any kind of reality except, perhaps, that of political extremists. But, when it comes to Epstein, and the wild web of powerful people he was connected to, there is no easy way to escape the conspiracy theorists. “Many people have come to me with wild conspiracy theories about this case,” said Lisa Bloom, the victims’ rights attorney, outside the Manhattan courthouse that has become a scene for Q-Anon demonstrations. “Of course, the Q-Anon people are crazy – they think Democrats eat babies – they’re nuts. But if you’d told me 10 years ago that Jeffrey Epstein had on his plane Donald Trump, Bill Clinton, Kevin Spacey, Chris Tucker and Prince Andrew I would have said you’re crazy. Turns out that’s true.” Class too, plays a role. In an early indication of how Maxwell’s defense counsel intends to play its hand, her team tried to undercut one of the first witnesses, “Jane”, by challenging her account of where she lived in Palm Beach and whether her gated community was attached to a “country club”. The implication was clear: jurors were being asked to believe that “Jane” came from better circumstances than she had described and was thus more knowing than indicated. “I don’t think I’ve ever had a case where a witness was always consistent in what they described,” Wendy J Murphy, a former Massachusetts prosecutor who teaches a course on sexual violence law at New England Law Boston, said. “In fact, I’d be nervous if they were because it comes across as parented and contrived.” While witness credibility is important, Murphy adds, “this case is about a widespread scheme of criminal conduct – really it’s organized crime. There’s so much corroboration and proof that this enterprise existed you don’t have to put as much stock in the credibility of individual victims.” But the question of how much of the overall Epstein-Maxwell story is salient to jurors and how much is too wild to believe is likely to be a concern for prosecutors, Murphy says. “The jurors’ job is to make sense of what they’re hearing,” Murphy said. “But when you’re talking about very unusual behavior at a very high level, most jurors won’t be comfortable thinking that influential people are inclined to do horrible things. And that, Murphy says, plays to the defense. “Ninety-nine per cent of jurors have no way to identify with the victim so it feels so uncomfortable to believe that it happened. They’d rather find reasonable doubt because it feels better to them about how the world works.” At the same time, she points out, the central theme of the charges against Maxwell – sex trafficking – is an accepted truth accruing to Epstein. “Jurors may think Maxwell was involved in something horrendous because she was involved with Epstein who is guilty because he’s dead,” Murphy suggested, and her defense’s argument that she might not have been prosecuted had Epstein lived would then fail to elicit sympathy. “Nobody cares,” Murphy points out. Few stories in recent years since 9/11 or the death of Diana, Princess of Wales have acquired as much conspiratorial baggage as Jeffrey Epstein, his alleged enablers and figures within their milieu. Most notorious among them, promoted by his own family, is that Epstein was murdered and not, as records suggest, successful in a second suicide attempt in a poorly run detention center. At the time, even elected officials, including the outgoing New York mayor, Bill de Blasio, said they did not understand how Epstein, facing multiple accusations of sexual abuse and sex trafficking, had managed to die by suicide. “It’s just too convenient,” De Blasio said. “It’s too many pieces happening simultaneously that don’t fit.” But it’s Maxwell, not Epstein, who is on trial, though Maxwell has consistently claimed that she is being tried as a substitute for the government’s failure to bring Epstein before a jury. “The charges against Ghislaine Maxwell are for things that Jeffrey Epstein did, but she is not Jeffrey Epstein,” Maxwell’s lawyer, Bobbi Sternheim, said in opening statements. But whether the trial can begin to parse the conspiracy that the government claims against Maxwell from the broader conspiracy theories around Epstein and his circle of bankers, politicians, scientists and social figures is hard to determine. Stephan Lewandowsky, a professor at the University of Bristol who has written widely on conspiracy theories, notes that the objects of such thinking nearly always attach to wealth and power of the type that Epstein personified and that perhaps Maxwell can hide behind. “I can’t think of a conspiracy theory that wouldn’t involve somebody famous or well-known, because no one cares about your grandmother or your cousin down the road. A conspiracy theory about someone no one has heard of isn’t going to be very attractive. You need a famous person as a place-marker,” he said. And these are conspiratorial times. Outside the court last week, Q-Anon sympathizers again revived ideas around Pizzagate, the baseless 2016 notion that Democrats around the Clintons were abusing children in a pizza parlor owned by a Democratic party fundraiser. “It’s all reminiscent of an age-old conspiracy theory known as antisemitism,” says Lewandowsky. “Abuse or sacrifice of children is very often part-political conspiracy theory.” It is in Maxwell’s interest to put Epstein on trial – and he cannot answer for even the most outlandish claims about him and his circle."

    "content": "Gareth Southgate has said some footballers are not vaccinated against Covid-19 because their opinions are influenced by conspiracy theories on social media about the jab. England’s manager was keen to offer a considered take on the subject before his side’s World Cup qualifier against Andorra, which was given the green light after being thrown into doubt for a couple of hours after a fire at the Estadi Nacional on Friday afternoon.\n\nSouthgate defended his players’ reluctance to support jabs publicly, even though they have been vocal on other social issues, and he suggested one problem preventing a larger uptake is some are more susceptible to rumours online. Vaccination rates vary across the Premier League and Tammy Abraham is the only England player to confirm he has been double-jabbed. The issue remains a sensitive topic around the England camp – Fikayo Tomori and Jesse Lingard argued this week that it was a personal choice – and Southgate, who dismissed reports that most of his players remain unvaccinated, offered a worrying insight into the mindset inside dressing rooms. “It is easy for me as a 50-year-old – the percentages for me, whatever marginal risks there were for having a vaccine, would be outweighed by the risks of catching the virus,” Southgate said. “Most of the players were back late and had to wait longer, a lot of them already caught the virus and – this is me theorising – maybe they feel they already have antibodies from that."

    "content": "A surge in Covid-19 conspiracy theories risks boosting antisemitism, hate crime campaigners have warned after the opening of an exhibition shedding light on interwar British fascism and its parallels today. The Wiener Holocaust Library in London is staging the exhibition – focusing on the motivations and propaganda of British fascists and their European peers in the 1920s and 30s – out of concern about the recent growth of far-right ideas and populism in the UK and abroad.\n\nRare photographs including one of a woman on the streets of London wielding a union flag with a swastika at its heart are featured in the exhibition. “We want – want quite consciously – to get people thinking about the parallels between the past and the present, as well as the differences,” said Dr Barbara Warnock, co-curator of the exhibition. She said a copy of Action, the newspaper of Oswald Mosley’s British Union of Fascists (BUF), carrying the headline The Return of Manhood, had similarities to the misogyny increasingly weaponised by the far right today. The newspaper’s front page also carries the Britain First motto – a fascist slogan that is also the name of a far-right group that last month had its application to register as political party approved by the Electoral Commission."

    "title": "Christian TV channel fined by Ofcom over Covid conspiracy theories",
    "content": "A Christian TV channel has been fined £25,000 by the UK broadcasting regulator for airing misleading and harmful statements about coronavirus, including that the rollout of 5G mobile networks caused the pandemic. Programmes aired at the height of the first wave last year on LoveWorld, which holds a UK broadcasting licence and is beamed around the world, claimed there was a “global cover-up” over the technology being the cause of the health crisis. At the time BT, which owns mobile operator EE and the Openreach subsidiary responsible for the UK’s broadband network, was facing attacks on its engineers and mobile phone masts as the false conspiracy theory was circulated. Another report by LoveWorld Television Ministry presented the antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine as a “cure” for Covid-19, without acknowledging that its efficacy and safety as a treatment was clinically unproven, or making it clear that it had potentially serious side-effects. The British media regulator, Ofcom, said the programme echoed claims by the former US president Donald Trump about the antimalarial medication, which drew mass international criticism. “The presenters make a number of unevidenced, materially misleading and potentially harmful statements about the coronavirus pandemic and vaccines, which were broadcast without providing adequate protection for viewers,” the regulator said in its ruling. “Ofcom considered these breaches to be serious. We previously directed LoveWorld not to repeat the programmes. Given the seriousness of the breaches, we also consider a further statutory sanction [of £25,000] is warranted.” A news programme aired last April titled “Why is 5G linked to Covid-19?” broadcast the claim that the mobile broadcast technology was a “very dangerous … weapon”. “When it comes into contact with a human body it can provide some poisons to the cells … This shows that what’s killing people, it’s not coronavirus, but 5G,” said a presenter. A sermon that was broadcast also cast “serious doubt” on the need for lockdown measures and the motives behind official health advice on Covid-19, including in relation to vaccination, Ofcom said. “Ofcom is clear that it is legitimate for broadcasters to discuss and scrutinise the government’s public health response to the coronavirus pandemic … and that it may be in the public interest to do so,” said Ofcom.\n\n“However, LoveWorld’s presentation of misleading claims without sufficient challenge or context risked causing serious potential harm to viewers, at a time when people were particularly likely to be seeking reliable information relating to the UK’s vaccination programme.” Christian Oyakhilome, a Nigerian pastor, founded the TV network’s associated church, Christ Embassy, in Lagos in 1987. The church has at least 90 branches in the UK and an estimated 13 million followers around the world."

    "title": "Why people believe Covid conspiracy theories: could folklore hold the answer?",
    "content": "Researchers have mapped the web of connections underpinning coronavirus conspiracy theories, opening a new way of understanding and challenging them. Using Danish witchcraft folklore as a model, the researchers from UCLA and Berkeley analysed thousands of social media posts with an artificial intelligence tool and extracted the key people, things and relationships. The tool enabled them to piece together the underlying stories in coronavirus conspiracy theories from fragments in online posts. The model that allows for narratives to be reconstructed from the noisy data of online updates, was designed by Prof Vwani Roychowdhury, who initiated the project, and was built by his team in the Electrical and Computer Engineering department at UCLA. One discovery from the research identifies Bill Gates as the reason why conspiracy theorists connect 5G with the virus. With Gates’ background in computer technology and vaccination programmes, he served as a shortcut for these storytellers to link the two. Gates is a persistent figure in the anti-vaccine stories. “He’s a great villain,” says the folklorist Prof Timothy Tangherlini who collaborated with Roychowdhury on the research. It’s Gates’ world-spanning influence in tech and then health that lodges him at the heart of a lot of conspiracies. “Bill Gates is in Africa, he’s in everybody’s house because everybody’s got computers, and then he’s pushing these vaccines.” Folklore isn’t just a model for the AI. Tangherlini, whose specialism is Danish folklore, is interested in how conspiratorial witchcraft folklore took hold in the 16th and 17th centuries and what lessons it has for today. Whereas in the past, witches were accused of using herbs to create potions that caused miscarriages, today we see stories that Gates is using coronavirus vaccinations to sterilise people. A version of this story that omits Gates but claims the vaccines have caused men’s testicles to swell, making them infertile, was repeated by the American rapper Nicki Minaj. The research also hints at a way of breaking through conspiracy theory logic, offering a glimmer of hope as increasing numbers of people get drawn in. The diagram below is a small section of the anti-vaccine stories that the researchers found. Mapping the coronavirus conspiracy theories\n\nWhy Bill Gates? One name comes up a lot. Why do people blame Gates for everything? He’s become a symbol for the worst parts of big tech, says Tangherlini. “He’s got information, he’s got computing power and he’s got more money than anyone else in the entire world.” And from that perspective, his philanthropy can be seen as suspect: “now he’s decided to tell you how to live your life”. And while the results of his philanthropy may be an objective good, the lack of accountability of his funding and foundation is something that worries people. There are non-conspiratorial criticisms of his position as the most powerful decision-maker in global health, affecting the lives and healthcare of millions of the world’s poorest people. He is not elected or accountable and though people know there is a lot of money, they are not sure where it is all going, or why. “He has this foundation that is a black box, and with black boxes you can ascribe all sorts of things to them. And he’s going out and doing something that reeks of colonialism – he’s going out to help the poor black and brown people in Africa. “Bill Gates is in Africa, he’s in everybody’s house because everybody’s got computers, and then he’s pushing these vaccines. And we already have prior storytelling about vaccines as threatening or dangerous or coming from the outside.” Tangherlini says this is not what he personally believes about Gates – but “he’s a great villain”. The storytelling around him resonates with the antisemitic narratives circulating for centuries in Europe. “This whole idea of a blood libel. And poisoning the wells, why not throw that in. Poisoning the wells is very similar to this faulty vaccination movement. You see how these motifs circulate? And they are interchangeable, it’s like algebra.” Why not Jeff Bezos? Partly it is Gates’ foray into global medicine that has given him omnipresent villain status, not to mention his contact with the likes of Jeffrey Epstein, but there are other factors that mean it is him and not Jeff Bezos or Larry Page, for example, who is at the centre of the conspiracy theory web. You can have only one person dominating these stories, says Tangherlini, and it is hard to add another one. “If I started telling stories about Jeff Bezos, and if my friend hears it, he will say, ‘It’s a good story but I’m going to turn it back to Bill Gates’, so there’s a regression to the mean. “In folklore, we have this law of self-correction. So if something doesn’t quite fit, you go back to the way you heard it from 15 other people. I might be saying Jeff Bezos. But if three other people are saying Bill Gates, it’s going to be Bill Gates.” Why do people believe things that seem so wrong? Conspiracy theories often crop up after catastrophic or unusual events and they thrive in environments where there is a lack of trusted information, says Tangherlini. In 16th and 17th century Denmark, catastrophic events from floods to poisonous algae mixed with the massive change brought by industrialisation. For those isolated on small farms, access to trusted, consistent information was scarce and stories about witches start to take hold. Today it’s clear that coronavirus has been a catastrophic event that has impacted everyone’s lives. On the face of it, a lack of information is not a problem in wealthy countries. However, the overload of information online can produce the same effect that Danish farmers faced several centuries ago – a lack of trusted information. This is where conspiratorial storytelling comes in and these stories start to get created. Then, as now, stories are a powerful way of talking about what we fear. Stories are good at getting our attention"

    "title": "Nike and Amazon among brands advertising on Covid conspiracy sites",
    "content": "Dozens of the world’s biggest brands, including Nike, Amazon, Ted Baker and Asos, have been advertising on websites that spread Covid-19 misinformation and conspiracy theories, it has emerged. The companies, as well as an NHS service, are among a string of household names whose ads appear to have helped fund websites that host false and outlandish claims, for example that powerful people secretly engineered the pandemic, or that vaccines have caused thousands of deaths. Analysis of nearly 60 sites, performed by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism and shared with the Observer, found that ads were placed through the “opaque” digital advertising market, which is forecast to be worth more than $455bn (£387bn) this year. Digital advertising is delivered through a complex networks of tech companies, including Google, that match online data about people with available advertising space and then sell access to web users as they browse. Experts said the design of this digital advertising architecture means that major brands, and their customers, may have been unwittingly funding Covid-19 misinformation. Dr Augustine Fou, an independent ad fraud researcher and former employee of advertising agency Omnicom, said the system of bidding on ads means these sites get mixed in with other, more benign ones. “Because they now have a source of funding, they can not only survive but also proliferate,” he said. “And that’s why we’re seeing this huge problem. Because of the lack of transparency … the companies and organisations buying the ads could be unaware that their marketing is appearing on – and potentially funding – these sources of misinformation. Ads for Amazon services were found on more than 30 sites that carried fake news ranging from Covid conspiracy theories involving Bill Gates to claims that mRNA vaccines are “toxic”. An NHS diabetes website was promoted alongside articles by a well-known anti-vaccine activist and the false claim that you cannot catch a virus. “We know the ad ecosystem is incredibly opaque,” says Raegan MacDonald from Mozilla, which makes the Firefox internet browser. “It’s almost like we’re not supposed to look under the hood. Because if you do, you find this mess.”\n\nMacDonald warns that the system is being “weaponised” and potentially putting public health at risk. “What I really hope is that this will be a sort of last straw for the brands,” she said. The bureau examined sites that host misinformation and also carry ads, using a combination of manual checking by researchers in the US and UK and automated systems that “crawl” sites to record what happens when someone visits them. The pages were identified with help from the Global Disinformation Index, with ad analysis provided by Rocky Moss, the co-founder and chief executive of ad quality platform Deepsee.io, and Braedon Vickers, who has built a search platform called Well-Known. Many of the companies that arrange digital advertising are little known outside the industry, which is dominated by Google. Analysis by Moss using Deepsee’s crawlers – which simulate a person visiting web pages – found ads delivered by Google for almost 30 big brands, each appearing on two or more misinformation websites. The most common were for Amazon Pharmacy, the drugstore run by the online retail giant, which itself has become a major player in digital advertising. Ads for Amazon Pharmacy, which is not available in the UK, accounted for more than 1% of 42,000 recorded by the “crawlers” and were found on more than 30 of the misinformation sites. Google didn’t address the presence of ads it delivered on sites identified by the bureau, but said it took appropriate action against breaches of policies on misinformation, including cutting off publishers’ ability to make money from specific pages, or their entire sites, following repeated breaches. “Protecting consumers and the credible businesses operating on our platforms is a priority for us,” a Google spokesperson told the bureau. After Amazon Pharmacy, the next most-featured advertisers were computer manufacturer Lenovo, which appeared on 11 sites, and US bank Discover. Lenovo said: “Like many companies today, Lenovo uses the Google AdSense platform to serve digital adverts to consumers across the internet. With any kind of digital advertising, we give clear guidance to our media partners and agencies on what is acceptable for our brand. Lenovo does not approve the placement of ads placed on Covid-19 misinformation websites and does not condone the content it appeared next to, and we’ll will work with our media partners to review our existing protection systems.” Ads for Nike, Honda, US pharmacy chain Walgreens and eBay were also among those recorded on multiple misinformation-spreading sites. British fashion firms Ted Baker and Asos, and the auction house Sotheby’s also appeared on multiple sites. Xyla Health & Wellbeing, which runs the NHS diabetes prevention programme, said it had acted to stop its messages appearing on the sites. The US Department of Veterans Affairs was promoted on two sites, one of which wrongly described mRNA vaccines as “the genetic modification injection” and claimed they made people more likely to catch Covid. The other site repeated the false claim that the coronavirus is no more dangerous than the flu. A spokesperson for American Honda said: “We are currently working to determine how our advertising may have appeared on the websites in question. We would never support Covid misinformation or knowingly allow our advertising on such websites. Honda strongly encourages our associates to become fully vaccinated and has conducted free vaccine clinics at our operations to make that possible.” A spokesperson for Ted Baker said: “The location of these adverts is driven by the Google Display Network. We can confirm that we have worked with Google to resolve this issue and that our adverts will not appear on these specific sites in the future.” Asos is understood to have added the misinformation sites to its banned list. A spokesperson said: “Like most other brands, we regularly review the websites that our ads appear on and have stringent requirements and processes in place to ensure that those websites align with our values, and those of our customers. “The available tools, however, will not always flag some smaller or newer sites. Where this happens, whenever an issue is brought to our attention, we take immediate action to ensure our ads are removed as we have done in this case.”"

    "content": "Your recent article about the conspiracy theorists QAnon (Facebook, QAnon and the world’s slackening grip on reality, 11 November) was illustrated with a highlighted quote stating “QAnon seems to turn people into angry, bitter, volatile people. It’s a mental health issue”. As practising clinical psychologists, a key part of our work is to reduce the widespread stigma and mythology about mental illness, both in our everyday parlance and on social media. Far too often we see mental health slurs used as insults or, for example, exploited by armchair psychologists who want to provide a lazy and populist diagnosis of the current US president. These pseudoscientific observations may grab headlines, but they add to the shaming and stigmatisation of people who struggle with mental health problems. We ask the Guardian to make a sustained and active effort to avoid language that promotes the fallacious link between mental illness and people judged to be angry, bitter and volatile characters.

    "title": "UK radio station censured over Covid conspiracy theories",
    "content": "A community radio station which broadcast a two-hour discussion of baseless coronavirus conspiracy theories, including the claim that the crisis is an orchestrated “plan-demic” linked to the rollout of 5G, has been sanctioned by the broadcasting regulator. In a report on New Style Radio, a Birmingham-based station which caters to African-Caribbean communities, Ofcom found that a programme presented by Simon Solomon, “had the potential to cause significant harm to listeners” and set out “a number of highly contentious, unevidenced conspiracy theories about the coronavirus, without sufficient challenge or context”. Among many other false claims made during The Family Programme on 1 November, the watchdog, which was responding to a listener’s complaint, highlighted suggestions that wearing facemasks can “cause serious neurological and respiratory damage”, that children were being put at risk, and that Bill Gates and Boris Johnson wanted to reduce the world population. During the broadcast, Solomon, who has been presenting the show for 18 years, asserted that there were “a host of people now speaking out against this so-called pandemic: countless physicians, doctors, medical people. Certainly, asserting the position, the position that this is not a pandemic, probably very much so a plan-demic”. He also said: “This information is really being shared on the basis that it will hopefully give you some insight into the plans of certain peoples across this beautiful planet to decrease the population.” Citing discredited claims from the conspiracy theorist Claire Edwards, he said that the coronavirus crisis “appears to be nothing more than a plan by these people, and I’ll be accused of creating conspiracy theories now … a plan by these people to decrease the world population. But you know the evidence is there.” And he said that Johnson and his father, Stanley, “had been speaking, you know, over a decade ago about reducing the world population”. In responding to Ofcom, Solomon acknowledged that the programme broke the regulator’s rules but stood by the substance of his claims. He said that his broadcast constituted scrutiny of the government and was “more than justified”, noting the disproportionate number of deaths in ethnic minority communities. New Style Radio, however, said that it “wholeheartedly accepted [Ofcom’s] analysis and conclusions” and had subsequently broadcast another programme in the same time slot, which set out the views of genuine experts on the pandemic in order to “comprehensively refute all the conspiracy theories” of the initial broadcast. Noting that Solomon was “experienced” and “knowledgable”, it said it “could not have possibly … envisaged” him presenting the show in such a way. It said it had done “as much as any licensee could be reasonably expected to do to prevent the breach in the first place and subsequently to ensure that there is no repetition of such a breach”. After Ofcom concluded that New Style Radio had committed a serious breach of the broadcasting code and was potentially harmful for listeners, it ordered the station to broadcast a summary of its ruling. It is still considering whether to impose a fine. Asked whether Solomon would continue to be a presenter on the station, a spokesperson said that it would await a final verdict on sanctions from Ofcom before making a decision."

    "title": "Hunting Ghislaine: unpicking truth from conspiracy in the Epstein saga",
    "content": "“You can feel sorry for someone,” says John Sweeney, “and still want them to face justice.” He’s talking about Hunting Ghislaine, the compelling podcast in which the investigative reporter unpicks the story of Ghislaine Maxwell, the 58-year-old British socialite who is currently in jail, awaiting trial for procuring and trafficking underage girls for the late sexual predator Jeffrey Epstein and others. Ghislaine, who denies the charges, faces 35 years in jail if convicted. Does he think she’s evil? By way of reply, Sweeney tells me that in January he testified against Darko Tasic, the Serbian fighter later jailed for his role in the 1999 massacre of 113 Albanian men and boys in Kosova. “That,” he says, “was evil.” As for Maxwell, Sweeney muses on the impact of adoring and being adored by her father Robert, who owned and plundered the Daily Mirror. Ghislaine was raised in a life of privilege at the 51-room Headington Hill Hall near Oxford, where her father had himself memorialised in stained glass as Samson bringing down the walls of Gaza. We learn from Hunting Ghislaine that he would urinate from his helipad atop the Daily Mirror building on to people below. He behaved worse in his office. “Maxwell also had the habit, common to megalomaniacs, of crapping in front of people. Perhaps not visibly doing it, but going to the loo with people waiting so would have to listen to him evacuating – whatever you want to call it.” When Robert Maxwell drowned, some speculated that he was pushed, others that he killed himself, and yet others that he was simply peeing overboard and lost his balance. “I think he was murdered,” Ghislaine told reporters. That theory was based on the idea that Robert was bumped off by Mossad because he knew too much. “I don’t buy that,” says Sweeney. “He had been useful to them because of his connections with [Romanian president Nicolae] Ceaușescu and other dictators. Killing him would have been difficult, expensive and irrelevant.”\n\nSweeney also investigates Epstein’s death, in particular the claims of a forensic pathologist, hired by his family, that the predator’s injuries suggest he was murdered. “His theory was that the fracture of the hyoid bone does not occur in the case of suicides but [is a sign of] strangulation. Unfortunately that’s bollocks.”"

    "title": "Conspiracy-theorist lawyer Sidney Powell spotted again at White House",
    "content": "The lawyer and conspiracy theorist Sidney Powell was back at the White House on Sunday night, reportedly to pitch Donald Trump on a plan to seize voting machines as the US president continues to dispute the result of November’s election, which he lost.\n\nTrump refuses to concede defeat by Joe Biden and continues to advance baseless claims of electoral fraud, despite Biden’s electoral college victory and regardless of the Democrat’s lead in the popular vote by more than 7m ballots. Over the weekend, Trump tweeted encouragement to Republicans reported to be considering challenges to the electoral college results when they come before Congress on 6 January. Such moves will in all likelihood not succeed in overturning the result, representing instead political appeals to the Republican base, many by senators who harbour White House aspirations of their own. Nonetheless, aides to the president, speaking anonymously, have told reporters they are concerned about Trump’s behaviour as inauguration day, 20 January, draws near. Powell was cut from Trump’s campaign team after spouting wild conspiracy theories but continues to advance the president’s cause. Spotted by CNN on Sunday night, she denied meeting the president and said it was “none of your business” why she was at the executive mansion. But she was among attendees at a Friday meeting at the White House at which Trump reportedly proposed naming her as special counsel to investigate alleged electoral fraud, and flirted with the pardoned former national security adviser Michael Flynn’s suggestion that the army might be used to rerun votes in battleground states. Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani was reported to have pooh-poohed the special counsel and martial law plans, but to have asked about seizing voting machines, all ideas knocked down by the chief of staff, Mark Meadows, and the White House counsel, Pat Cipollone. Speaking to the Wall Street Journal, one White House aide said Trump’s current strategy for holding on to power amounted to: “Let’s throw a giant plate of spaghetti at the wall and hope that at least one noodle sticks.” Maggie Haberman, one of the New York Times reporters who broke news of the Friday meeting, tweeted: “Sources who have gotten used to Trump’s eruptions over four years sound scared by what’s transpired in the past week.” Haberman also said Powell had returned to the White House to pitch “an executive order on seizing voting machines to examine them, per a person with knowledge of the meeting”. On Monday, outgoing attorney general William Barr told reporters that though he was “sure there was fraud in this election” it was not “systemic or broad-based” and he would not name a special counsel to investigate such claims. Barr also said he saw “no basis right now for seizing machines”. “If I thought a special counsel at this stage was the right tool,” he said, “I would name one. But I haven’t and I’m not going to.”"

    "title": "Survey uncovers widespread belief in 'dangerous' Covid conspiracy theories",
    "content": "Significant numbers of people around the world believe Covid-19 was created deliberately, has killed far fewer people than reported, or is a hoax and does not actually exist, according to a global survey. Along with belief in other conspiracy theories – such as that the world is run by a secret cabal – the YouGov-Cambridge Globalism Project, a survey of about 26,000 people in 25 countries designed in collaboration with the Guardian, found widespread and concerning scepticism about vaccine safety. Among the most widely believed Covid conspiracies is that the death rate of the virus, which according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker has so far killed nearly 1.1 million people worldwide, has been “deliberately and greatly exaggerated”. Nearly 60% of respondents in Nigeria said this was definitely or probably true, along with more than 40% in Greece, South Africa, Poland and Mexico. About 38% of Americans, 36% of Hungarians, 30% of Italians and 28% of Germans felt the same. There is evidence the coronavirus pandemic has prompted some people to say they trust experts more, but it has also triggered a wave of disinformation and fake news propagated by science deniers and conspiracy theorists that has spread virally on social networks.\n\n“Any scary event – a pandemic, a mass shooting – that denies people a sense of control will lead to a proliferation of conspiracy theories,” said Stephan Lewandowsky, a cognitive psychologist at the University of Bristol who is an expert on misinformation. “They give people a sense of psychological comfort: the feeling that they are not at the mercy of randomness. They’re dangerous at any time, but more so in a pandemic if they lead people to ignore official advice, or commit acts of vandalism or violence.” But conspiracy theories also thrived on “governments’ inability to have a clear message”, said Lewandowsky. “They are another reason why we all need clear, consistent, evidence-based policymaking that can be trusted.” Among other countries, roughly one in four French and one in five British and Spanish respondents believed the death rate of the virus had been exaggerated, while Australians, Swedes and Japanese were more likely to dismiss such a belief. Significant numbers also thought the virus had been “deliberately created and spread” by the Chinese or US government, while in Poland one in five people believed it was definitely or probably a complete myth, created by unidentified “powerful forces”. Roughly the same proportions in Turkey, Egypt and Saudi Arabia said they agreed with that proposition, while in the US the figure reached 13%. The false claim that 5G mobile technology is to blame for the spread of Covid-19 also has plenty of adherents, according to the survey, which was conducted in July and August. More than a fifth of respondents in Turkey, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Nigeria and South Africa believed it was definitely or probably true that symptoms were “caused or enhanced by the direct, physical effects on the human body” of 5G. More than half of Nigerians, more than 40% of South Africans, Poles and Turks, more than 35% of Americans, Brazilians and Spaniards and between one in four and one in five French, British, Italian and German respondents believed it was definitely or probably true that Covid-19 had been deliberately created and spread by the Chinese government. Significant numbers also thought the US government was responsible for creating and spreading the virus: as many as 37% of respondents in Turkey, against one in five in Greece and Spain, 16% in Poland, 12% in France and just 5% in the UK. About 17% of American citizens said they believed it was definitely or probably true that their own government was to blame. The survey also tested belief levels in common non-Covid conspiracy theories, finding between 20% and 30% support in 10 countries – including South Africa, Brazil, Hungary and Poland – for the belief that manmade global heating was “a hoax invented to deceive”. Similar proportions thought the moon landings were faked, while between 20% and 30% of respondents in Spain, France, the US, Italy and Germany thought the US government “knowingly helped make the 9/11 terrorist attacks happen”. Between 20% and 44% of people in 17 countries believed or thought it likely that humans had made contact with aliens. The most widely held conspiracy theory by some distance, however, was that despite who may officially be in charge of national governments and other organisations, there was “a single group of people who secretly control events and rule the world together”. This was held to be “definitely or probably true” by more than 20% of respondents across 20 countries, including 28% of Britons, 36% of French respondents, 37% of Americans, 45% of Italians, 47% of Poles, 55% of Spaniards, 68% of South Africans and 78% of Nigerians. The survey revealed widespread and significant anti-vaccination sentiment, a matter of serious concern to many governments that hope soon to be able to inoculate their populations against Covid-19. Across 19 different countries 20% or more of respondents said they gave at least some credibility to the view that “the truth about the harmful effects of vaccines is being deliberately hidden from the public”, including 57% of South Africans, 48% of Turks, 38% of French people, 33% of Americans, 31% of Germans and 26% of Swedes. While the UK was among the countries with the lowest rates of anti-vaccination sentiment, almost one in five people – 19% – still agreed either wholly or partially with the statement. Research by the Guardian recently found engagement with anti-vaccination content on Facebook had trebled in a month."

    "title": "The dead voter conspiracy theory peddled by Trump voters, debunked",
    "content": "Late last week, Students for Trump founder Ryan Fournier declared on social media that he had unearthed definitive proof of widespread voter fraud in Detroit. He pointed to an absentee ballot cast by “118-year-old William Bradley”, a man who had supposedly died in 1984. “They’re trying to steal the election,” Fournier warned in a since-deleted Facebook post, though the election had already been called for Joe Biden by every major news network days before. But the deceased Bradley hadn’t voted. Within days, Bradley’s son, also named William Bradley, but with a different middle name, told PolitiFact that he had cast the ballot. That was confirmed by Michigan election officials, who said a clerk had entered the wrong Bradley as having voted. Though the living Bradley had also received an absentee ballot for his father, he said he threw it away, “because I didn’t want to get it confused with mine”. The false claim that the deceased Bradley had voted in the 3 November election is one of a barrage of voter fraud conspiracy theories fired off by Trump supporters across the country during recent weeks, and all have been debunked while failing to prove that widespread irregularities exist. Instead, the theories often reveal Trump supporters’ fundamental misunderstandings of the election system while creating a game of conspiracy theory whack-a-mole for election officials. “We are confident Michigan’s election was fair, secure and transparent, and the results are an accurate reflection of the will of the people,” secretary of state spokesperson Tracy Wimmer told the Guardian. Bradley was only one of dozens of allegedly dead Michigan voters who were found to be alive. Trump supporters pointed to Napoleon Township’s Jane Aiken, who they claimed was born in 1900, and cited an obituary as evidence that she was deceased. But the township’s deputy police chief investigated and found the obituary to be for a different Jane Aiken.\n\nPolice told Bridge Magazine that the Aiken who cast the ballot is “94 years old, alive and well. Quite well, actually.” Meanwhile, CNN examined records for 50 Michiganders who Trump supporters claim are dead voters. They found 37 were dead and had not voted. Five are alive and had voted, and the remaining eight are also alive but didn’t vote. The Michigan secretary of state cited several reasons for confusion. Though election officials across the country purge dead people from voter rolls annually, some are missed and remain as registered voters. Occasionally a worker will accidentally enter a vote by a living person as being cast by a dead person with a similar name. The voting software in Michigan also requires a birthday for each voter. If a clerk doesn’t have it, then 1/1/1901 is used as a placeholder until the clerk can find the accurate birthday. Rightwing conspiracy theorists pointed to multiple examples of residents with that birthday voting. Among them was Donna Brydges, a 75-year-old Hamlin Township resident. In a phone call with the Associated Press this week, she confirmed she’s alive and passed the phone to her husband so he could do the same. He added: “She’s actually beat me in a game of cribbage.” Michigan election officials, “are not aware of a single confirmed case showing that a ballot was actually cast on behalf of a deceased individual,” the secretary of state wrote on its website. Similarly, in Pennsylvania, Trump supporters like Representative Matt Gaetz claimed 21,000 dead people in the state “overwhelmingly swung for Biden”. In reality, the conservative Public Interest Legal Foundation had filed an 15 October federal lawsuit claiming 21,000 dead people were on the rolls, and asked a judge to order them to be removed before the election. A judge found that more than half of the voters had already been removed, questioned PILF’s intentions and methodology, and didn’t require the state to take action. The dead voter theory is only one one of the several conspiracies Trump supporters have used to cast doubt on election results. In Pennsylvania, a postal worker who claimed to have heard a supervisor directing staff to backdate late-arriving ballots recanted his allegation once he was visited by postal service investigators. In Arizona and Michigan, Trump supporters filed a lawsuit claiming that votes were tossed out because they had used Sharpie markers to fill out their ballot, but quickly dropped it. Several viral videos also purported to reveal suspicious activity. In Detroit, Trump supporters claimed a video showed someone bringing late-arriving mail in ballots into a vote-counting center. In reality, it was a WXYZ Detroit cameraman wheeling his equipment in a wagon. Meanwhile, a video that Eric Trump claimed showed 80 Trump ballots being set on fire was proven to be false – the ballots were sample ballots. The Trump campaign also claimed that recent federal lawsuits would prove widespread voter fraud with hundreds of pages of testimony from poll watchers and ballot challengers in Michigan. Almost all of them have failed in court so far. Though Trump and his supporters have claimed thousands of dead people voted in Michigan, only one allegation was included in the lawsuits. Warren, Michigan resident Anita Chase wrote in an affidavit that her deceased son, Mark D Chase, who had died in July 2016, was marked in the secretary of state’s online voter tool as having voted in the 2016 and 2020 presidential elections. But the secretary of state said Anita Chase had identified one of two other Mark D Chases registered to vote in Michigan – a ballot had not been cast in her son’s name. In their response to the affidavits, Detroit election officials lambasted the Trump campaign over such errors: “Most of the objections raised in the submitted affidavits are grounded in an extraordinary failure to understand how elections function.”"

    "title": "Berlin: vandalism of museum artefacts 'linked to conspiracy theorists'",
    "content": "At least 70 artworks and ancient artefacts across three galleries on Berlin’s museum island were vandalised with an oily substance earlier this month, German media has reported. Objects including Egyptian sarcophagi, stone sculptures and 19th-century paintings held at the Pergamon Museum, the Alte Nationalgalerie and the Neues Museum sustained visible damage during the attack on 3 October, according to reports in the weekly Die Zeit and broadcaster Deutschlandfunk on Tuesday. News of the attack was kept from the public for more than two weeks. The Prussian Heritage Foundation, which oversees the museum island collections, reportedly confirmed that objects in the exhibitions had sustained damage. Police in the German capital said they had launched an investigation but would not comment on a motive behind the attack. In 2018 two women were arrested in the Greek capital, Athens, after smearing museum exhibits at the National Museum of History with an oily substance. The two women, later identified as being of Bulgarian origin, told police they were spraying the artworks with oil and myrrh “because the Holy Scripture says it is miraculous”. But German media have linked the museum island attack to conspiracy theories pushed through social media channels by prominent coronavirus deniers in recent months.\n\nOne such theory claims that the Pergamon Museum is the centre of the “global satanism scene” because it holds a reconstruction of the ancient Greek Pergamon Altar. Attila Hildmann, a former vegan celebrity chef who has become one of Germany’s best-known proponents of the baseless QAnon conspiracy theory, posted messages on Telegram in August and September in which he suggested that the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, was using the altar for “human sacrifices”. On Tuesday night Hildmann, who has over 100,000 followers on his public Telegram channel, posted a link to the Deutschlandfunk article with the words: “Fact! It is the throne of Baal (Satan).”"

    "title": "Covid: Totnes concerns reflect UK-wide rise in conspiracy theories",
    "content": "Like many people living in or around Totnes in Devon, David, who is in his 70s, has his own theories about coronavirus and its origins. Sitting in the armchair of his house, he says the pandemic is a secret plot to impose a totalitarian world government and a nefarious effort to crush freedom. He scrolls through Facebook, which he recently signed up to, to show many with similar beliefs. David came to many of these ideas recently. When the pandemic hit, he started looking for answers. “I’m friends with a few people who are active in researching what is going on. I quickly made contact with others putting posts on the internet.” He is strongly opposed to 5G, believing mobile phone signals either transmit the virus or reduce our defences to it, and has said he would not accept a vaccine as it would involve injecting nanoparticles into the body that would allow people to be controlled. While such views are not the norm, they can be found around the country, and MPs have warned that misinformation about the pandemic is spreading “virulently” because the UK still lacks a law to regulate social media. It is a problem that has come into sharp focus since the announcement that a Covid vaccine could be within reach, with trials finding a new jab to be 90% effective. Concern has been raised about the uptake of such a vaccine, or false rumours that might deter people from getting it. “Vaccine misinformation has been out there ever since the first vaccines were made,” said England’s deputy chief medical officer Prof Jonathan Van-Tam on Monday. “And it is exactly that, misinformation.”\n\nPeople in Totnes are known for questioning “the mainstream narrative”, says its mayor, Jacqi Hodgson. The take-up for one dose of the MMR vaccine by five-year-olds was 78%, according to figures for 2018-19, well below the national target of 95%. Last year, campaigners persuaded the council to put a moratorium on the rollout of 5G after being inspired by the conspiracy theory that it is bad for your health. Since the start of the pandemic, leaflets about the dangers of wearing masks have been slipped through doors, a weekly meeting takes place to discuss theories about the origins of the virus and since August protesters have regularly appeared in the town centre. Hodgson says that some of those handing out leaflets encouraging people not to wear masks have become pushier. “They have been pushing leaflets on to people’s hands. One person insisted on giving me a leaflet and I said it was reckless not to encourage people to wear masks.” “People have been gathering more and more [since the start of the pandemic] … They were holding rallies on Saturday afternoon in the market square and upsetting the market traders.” The local council has even struggled to pedestrianise a part of the high street due to a backlash from those who believe the pandemic is a hoax. Peter Shearn, the editor of Totnes Pulse, a community not-for-profit magazine, said: “There is a Facebook group for locals and it has become very aggressive and bitey, with people arguing. What has happened is people who were behind QAnon narratives [a global movement claiming there is a secret satanic network of child-abusing politicians and celebrities] hold hands with the very far left. It’s sort of gone full circle.” One person who does not believe in wearing masks is Steve, who works as a psychotherapist. “Masks are used to maintain fear as it is obviously not a pandemic,” he says. “When you break the statistics down … the average age of death from the virus is over life expectancy. Mental health suffers, the economy is destroyed and we know what happens with economic downturns: people die.” A distrust of the scientific and governmental consensus on the pandemic can be seen nationally. A May study, funded by Oxford Health BRC, showed 60% of adults believe to some extent that the government was misleading the public about the cause of the virus. “We’re not just battling the virus,” said the WHO director-general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, in August. “We’re also battling the trolls and conspiracy theorists that push misinformation and undermine the outbreak response.” Earlier in the summer, residents of Totnes and others in the South Hams area, the district the town is in, reported having leaflets dropped through their doors promoting the idea that mask-wearing was detrimental to health. They argued that wearing masks was linked to too much carbon dioxide in the blood and a weakened immune system. Carole Boulanger, a consultant nurse from Royal Devon and Exeter NHS foundation trust, said that coronavirus was a “serious illness” that “people need to take seriously”. “There are people who think it’s manufactured and there is some big plot, but we have Covid-19 in the area, in the country and in the world. It is causing a lot of illness and mortality for the population,” she added. While the south-west has the lowest proportion of deaths of any area of England, infection rates have been rising in Devon since September, with 736 new cases between 1 and 7 November. There have been 5,935 cases in total. Boulanger said that there was frustration in the south-west because infection numbers were low, and people working in the area’s vast tourist industry had experienced a huge hit to businesses. However, she added there should also be caution due to the high number of older people in the area who are at risk from the virus. She said that there was also limited capacity in hospitals and the area would need to deal with normal winter pressures, as well as the virus this year, which meant people should take it seriously. “Most people I am in contact with have either got it or had it … or their relatives are in the intensive care unit with it. That is a poignant way of appreciating that this illness is fact and not a hoax.”"

    "title": "It's only fake-believe: how to deal with a conspiracy theorist",
    "content": "Unless you’ve been on a silent retreat for the past year, you will have almost certainly heard the rumours – that the pandemic is an elaborate hoax, or that the virus was created as a Chinese weapon, or that dangerous elites are trying to kill off the elderly and to establish a new world order, or that the symptoms are caused by 5G. It is troubling enough to see these ideas on social media. But when you are hearing them from your family, your friends, or a casual acquaintance, it is even harder to know how to respond. You are going to struggle to convince the most committed believers, of course, but what about people who are only flirting with the ideas? These difficult conversations are only set to increase now that a new vaccine is on the horizon. Certain niches of internet are already rife with the “plandemic” theory, which alleges that the spread of the virus has been designed to create big bucks for pharmaceutical companies and the philanthropist Bill Gates (whose charity is funding many of the efforts). The idea has been debunked numerous times, whereas there is good evidence that conspiracy theorists such as David Icke are themselves reaping huge profits from spreading misinformation. The danger, of course, is that their ideas will discourage people from taking the vaccine, leaving them vulnerable to the actual disease.\n\nSince many conspiracy theories arise from feelings of uncertainty and fear, an angry debate will only cement the ideas, and open ridicule is even less constructive (see panel, below). Instead, the research shows that you should try to focus on the rhetorical devices and tricks of persuasion that have been used to spread the ideas in the first instance. “People seem receptive to you exposing the ways in which they may have been manipulated,” explains Dr Sander van der Linden at Cambridge University, who has pioneered research into the spread of misinformation and the ways to stop it. Fortunately, the exponents of these conspiracy theories often use the same rhetorical devices, and a familiarity with these arguments will help you to politely articulate the faulty reasoning behind many different forms of misinformation. Read on to discover the five most common fallacies favoured by conspiracy theorists, and the best ways to respond."

    "title": "Trump wanted conspiracy theorist Sidney Powell as special counsel on voter fraud",
    "content": "Donald Trump pushed to have the lawyer and “kraken” conspiracy theorist Sidney Powell named as a special counsel to investigate supposed electoral fraud, as he grasps for straws to stay in power.\n\nThe development was first reported by the New York Times on Saturday, citing two anonymous sources. The NYT said most presidential advisers including personal attorney Rudy Giuliani pushed back against the plan, which Trump floated at a meeting on Friday. The Times also reported that Trump asked aides about the former national security adviser Michael Flynn’s suggestion of deploying the US military to battleground states, in order to re-stage votes central to Joe Biden’s victory. “That was also shot down,” the well-sourced reporter Maggie Haberman wrote, drily, on Twitter. Trump pardoned Flynn, who pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI during the Russia investigation, in November. Biden’s victory has been certified by the electoral college and the Democrat leads in the popular vote by more than 7m ballots. Nonetheless, Trump has refused to concede and claims without evidence that the election was rigged against him. It was reported this week that he had threatened not to leave the White House on inauguration day, 20 January. “He’s throwing a fucking temper tantrum,” CNN quoted an unnamed adviser as saying. “He’s going to leave. He’s just lashing out.” But the same report cited an anonymous source as saying the atmosphere in the White House had “turned crazy”. Trump’s legal team suffered more than 50 defeats in court cases over electoral fraud. Powell was cut from the team almost a month ago, after making bizarre claims including that voting software used in key states was created at the direction of the Venezuelan president Hugo Chávez, who died in 2013. She also promised to “release the kraken”, a reference to a terrible sea monster of myth and legend. No kraken, legal or otherwise, was forthcoming. The Times report about Trump’s wish to bring her back into the fold came shortly after the president played down Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s admission that a vast hack against the US government and private companies had been carried out by Russia. Powell “was at the White House for a meeting that became raucous at times”, the Times said. “Other administration officials drifted in and out … and the White House counsel, Pat Cipollone, pushed back on the ideas being proposed. “Ms Powell accused other Trump advisers of being quitters … but the idea that Mr Trump would try to install Ms Powell in a position to investigate the outcome sent shock waves through the president’s circle.” The paper also said Giuliani had “separately pressed the Department of Homeland Security to seize possession of voting machines”, but had been “told the department does not have the authority to do such a thing”. On Twitter, Haberman added: “The fact of the meeting – and Giuliani hope of seizing the voting machines – has alarmed some of the president’s advisers, who see his … refusal to accept the election results as in a dangerous new place.”"

    "title": "Why did the Sun publish a far-right conspiracy theory? | Daniel Trilling",
    "content": "On Saturday, the Sun published an exclusive story by its political editor, Tom Newton Dunn, which announced that a group of former British intelligence officers had uncovered a “hard-left extremist network” at the heart of the Labour party. “HIJACKED LABOUR” declared the piece, which went on to claim that Jeremy Corbyn sits at the centre of a “spider’s web of extensive contacts” that stretch “from Marxist intellectuals to militant groups and illegal terror organisations”.\n\nThe piece directed readers towards a website featuring a network map that it said had been compiled by ex-military veterans “in their spare time” to reveal “what they insist is now a party firmly in the grip of a hardline cabal”. Each of the 490 organisations or individuals listed was presented as a node on a network, with an attached fact file and further reading links. But when readers began to inspect the map more closely, we found that several entries on the chart included extreme rightwing material among their sources. One fact file recommended a “critique” of anti-fascism posted on the antisemitic conspiracy website the Millennium Report – which also features articles on such topics as “the Jewish hand in the world wars” and “exposing Jewish Zionism”. Another fact file pointed readers towards the website Aryan Unity – once the mouthpiece of the British People’s party, a defunct neo-Nazi group. These were presented without caveats, as apparently trustworthy sources. Before the end of the day, the story had been removed from the paper’s website – without acknowledgement or explanation from Newton Dunn or his bosses. (The Sun declined to comment, and Newton Dunn has not responded to my questions.) This was more than a case of sloppy sourcing: the map itself is drenched in conspiratorial thinking. It describes obvious political connections – for instance, that Corbyn and other senior Labour MPs are linked to trade union officials – in a way that implies these are part of a wider shadowy network. This network apparently includes the IRA, Hamas and the Colombian guerilla group Farc; “radical” members of the British Medical Association; and various anti-war, anti-racist and anarchist groups, many of whom don’t even get on with each other. The chart also links Corbyn’s Labour party to a range of living and deceased philosophers, including Stanley Fish, “Jacques Derrida RIP” and “Richard Rorty RIP”. The argument here is that this “hard-left extremist network” shares an insidious and unpatriotic ideology: “postmodern neo-Marxism”. As one of the researchers told the Sun, this is “an ideology which specifically encourages its supporters to tell lies, because it denies the existence of any absolute truth”. Various independent media outlets were featured on the map, including openDemocracy – George Soros was listed among its funders – as well as a number of high-profile journalists, including Guardian contributors. So how did the Sun, one of the UK’s most widely read newspapers, come to publish it? The answer reveals how easily far-right conspiracy theories now circulate between fringe outlets and the mainstream media. The map linked to by the Sun closely resembles an earlier graphic that first appeared online in August, under the name the Traitor’s Chart. The earliest mention of it that I can find is on an obscure website called Country Squire Magazine, which said it had received a press release about the map. That article, since deleted, had a publication date of 21 August. The website’s only other significant intervention to date has been a pro-Brexit polemic that described Ireland as a “land of puppy farms, rain-soaked holidays, dingy bars, drugs mule celebs, verbal diarrhoea and squeaky fiddles”, also now deleted."

    "title": "Farage under fire for conspiracy claims linked to antisemitism",
    "content": "Nigel Farage has faced renewed criticism for discussing tropes and conspiracy theories associated with the far right and antisemitism after it emerged he said migration would “imperil the future of our civilisation” and called Goldman Sachs “the enemy”. In an interview earlier this year with a tiny UK evangelical Christian TV channel, Revelation TV, the Brexit party leader alleged that banks and multinational corporations were trying to created a dictatorial world government. The discussion, uncovered by the group Hope Not Hate, saw Farage single out Goldman Sachs, the investment bank founded by Jewish immigrant to the US that is often the focus of antisemitic conspiracy theories. Farage also repeatedly used phrases such as “globalists” and “new world order”, which regularly feature in antisemitic ideas. Discussing the necessity of preventing migrants who cross the Mediterranean into Europe from entering the UK, Farage said: “If we allow it to continue, we will actually, through our compassion, imperil the future of our civilisation.”\n\nThe notion that European countries will have their cultures superseded by mass immigration is a repeated element of far-right ideas, such as the so-called “great replacement” theory. Farage has talked little about immigration or culture during an election campaign in which coverage of the Brexit party has largely focused on his decision to not stand for a parliamentary seat and to withdraw hundreds of candidates from Conservative-held seats. However, the emergence of the footage, from an interview broadcast by Revelation TV, has reignited criticism of Farage’s judgment, and his willingness to engage in discussion of conspiracy theories associated with the far right and antisemitism. In May, Farage was criticised by the UK’s leading Jewish organisations after it emerged he had repeatedly taken part in interviews with a far-right US talkshow host, openly discussing similar conspiracy theories about a plot for a global government. Farage undertook six interviews with Alex Jones of the conspiracy theory website Infowars, who was sued by bereaved parents after claiming the 2012 Sandy Hook US school shooting was faked. He later faced renewed criticism from Jewish groups and others after it emerged he also repeatedly used themes associated with antisemitism to criticise the financier George Soros. The Brexit party leader has previously declined to engage with the criticisms, with a party spokesman having called the accusations “pathetic”. Farage’s representatives were contacted again for comment."

    "title": "Sons of Denmark review – conspiracy thriller takes a shocking turn",
    "content": "Sons of Denmark is the debut feature of Danish director Ulaa Salim, drawing on his observations of that country as the child of Iraqi-born parents. It is a strange film and, having found it initially engaging and even quite exciting, it left a strange taste in my mouth. This is a conspiracy thriller with a plot that takes you to unexpected places. But it doesn’t live up to the (high) expectations engendered by its opening act – and then the film simply left me behind with a crassly violent and questionably conceived acid-attack scene, targeted at a woman, there to facilitate a revenge flourish that does not close down the narrative in any satisfactory way. The setting is Denmark a few years into the future where anti-Muslim, anti-Arab nationalism is on the march. A white power group calling itself Sons of Denmark is creating disorder on the streets and a far-right political leader called Martin Nordahl (Rasmus Bjerg) is profiting from the mayhem, though he is careful to keep a legal distance from the violent goons who idolise him. Meanwhile, Zakaria (Mohammed Ismail Mohammed), a young Muslim man who has been radicalised by the situation, joins a secret cell and is trained by Ali (Zaki Youssef) in a plan to assassinate Nordahl. But things go awry. In its opening stages, the film reminded me of something that Susanne Bier might have directed, or maybe a TV drama like The Wire or the Israeli thriller Fauda. There are interesting switchbacks and chicanes in the narrative, with surprises as to what and who it is actually about. But then, as it chugs on to the two-hour mark, there is that strange violent moment directed at a woman. And women haven’t exactly been important to the story before that, or after that. A disappointment. • Sons of Denmark is released in the UK on 13 December."

    "title": "How to fend off your conspiracy obsessed relatives during the holiday season",
    "content": "It’s the holidays: time for eggnog, ironic Christmas sweaters, and interactions with relatives you’d avoid like the plague if you didn’t share DNA. Perhaps in past years, you’ve argued politics over the dinner table. But thanks to our internet echo chambers, things may now get even weirder. You could find yourself not just arguing over Donald Trump’s impeachment, but also over whether the president and Robert Mueller were secretly teaming up to expose Tom Hanks as a cannibal; or whether the Federal Reserve exists because JP Morgan sank the Titanic; or whether Meghan Markle is a robot. So what do you do if, after a few drinks, Uncle Ted starts screaming that the world is flat? We offer a few handy strategies: Fire back with an even weirder theory of your own. When Ted claims that Ruth Bader Ginsburg is dead and the person posing as the beloved supreme court justice is actually a body double, nod vigorously. Then, slowly pulling a tinfoil hat from your pocket, reveal that it all goes further: the body double is actually Tupac, who embraced the moniker Notorious RBG as a peace offering to his former rival. None of this came as a surprise to you, of course, because everyone involved was a known lizard person, which, if you think about it, explains how aliens from Roswell killed JFK and faked the moon landing. Keep pushing until your uncle excuses himself in a moment of deep self-reflection. Tell him what he’s saying must be true, because you heard it first from Hillary Clinton. The former secretary of state is the Rome of conspiracy theories: all roads lead to her.Convince your relative Clinton believes his bonkers claim, and he’ll begin to question everything he knows. Begin dispensing cryptic messages yourself. Set up an online account under a pseudonym, and begin issuing a slow drip of accurate messages to distract the conspiracy-minded from their favorite nonsense. Post weekly on an obscure subreddit, telling seemingly innocuous personal stories with the third letter of each word in bold. Taken together, these letters spell out the text of articles from Snopes.com. (Anything so secretive must be accurate.) Then tip off your relative to the new mysterious account you’ve been following. Looking around furtively, inform him the conspiracy theory is exactly what the government wants him to believe. In fact, you too had believed it for ages, until QAnon himself DMed you with the shocking truth: the deep state has been feeding us falsehoods about Democratic servers in Ukraine and hurricanes hitting Alabama in order to distract from their real dastardly deeds. Fortunately, if he wants the actual story, there is a cabal of truth-tellers who publish facts online. They’ll even write down the facts, roll them up and leave them in his driveway every morning, for a small fee. If all else fails, descend, very gradually, under the table. Each time your uncle drives home a new, indisputable fact proving that Paul McCartney’s been dead since Sgt Pepper, slump a bit further down in your chair. If you do it slowly enough, he’ll be too wrapped up in feeding you the red pill to notice that you’re shrinking. Once your head is fully under the table, make a break for the kitchen and never return. Of course, there’s a small chance none of this will work, and you’ll need to resort to better-researched tactics. Experts say the best approach is a gentle one, and you probably won’t change anyone’s mind in one night. Listen to your relative rather than relegating her to pariah status, and ideally come equipped with accurate information rather than just telling her she’s wrong, the cognitive scientist Nadia Brashier tells PBS. Mick West, author of Escaping the Rabbit Hole: How to Debunk Conspiracy Theories Using Facts, Logic, and Respect, writes that the goal is to present the conspiracist “with information that they are lacking, and doing it all in a manner that will encourage them to look at what you are presenting without rejecting you as an idiot or a government shill”. In other words, when you’re explaining to your aunt that Australia does, in fact, exist, be ready with accurate information about kangaroos – and accept that she might not be convinced before dessert."

    "title": "Why the Leeds hospital conspiracy theory is so seductive to Conservatives | Tom Whyman",
    "content": "The photograph of a four-year-old boy asleep on the floor of Leeds General Infirmary because of a lack of beds has become a fixture of this final week of the general election: not just as an illustration of the damage almost 10 years of Tory rule have done to the NHS, but because of the prime minister’s cartoonishly callous reaction to it. The photo is horribly, brutally real. Dr Yvette Oade, the chief medical officer at Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS trust, personally apologised for how the boy and his family were treated. But this did not prevent a conspiracy theory from emerging. Across social media, a paragraph of identical text was shared, by multiple users often purporting to be the original, suggesting that the boy in the picture was planted there by his Labour activist mother, precisely to discredit the Tories on the NHS. The text was originally shared on the Facebook page of a woman who works as a medical secretary, who claimed afterwards that her account had been “hacked”. The post was given considerable amplification by Conservative candidates, former MPs, a former England cricket captain, Kevin Pietersen, as well as the Telegraph columnist Allison Pearson, who quoted the text almost as if it had been sent to her by a source.\n\nThis kind of conspiratorial thinking has become all too familiar in recent years: the Leeds case almost directly parallels what happened when Boris Johnson visited Whipps Cross hospital in London earlier this year, and was berated by the father of a sick newborn who was later accused of being a plant. But there is a tendency to discuss this sort of conspiratorialism – note this very useful Twitter thread on photo-gate – primarily in terms of disinformation or “fake news”, as if what matters most about it is that people are being factually misinformed. “Facts” and “truth” are being insufficiently defended: bad information is being allowed to push out good. But there’s a deeper and more troubling question that doesn’t get asked as often: why do people find misinformation like this convincing – and feel driven to share it or comment approvingly in reply to it?"

    "title": "Sandy Hook father awarded $450,000 after suing conspiracy theorist",
    "content": "The father of a boy killed in the 2012 Sandy Hook school shooting has been awarded $450,000 by a jury in Wisconsin after he sued a conspiracy theorist who claimed the massacre never happened. Leonard Pozner, whose six-year-old son Noah was among the 26 victims at Sandy Hook elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut, sued James Fetzer and co-author Mike Palacek over their book Nobody Died at Sandy Hook, which claimed Noah’s death certificate is fake and Pozner lied about his son being dead. While Palacek reached an undisclosed settlement with Pozner last month, the defamation suit proceeded against Fetzer. In court, Pozner, a retired Minnesota professor, claimed the statements and the harassment he had received because of the book had given him post-traumatic stress disorder. Among them were death threats he received from Lucy Richards, a member of a group that believes Sandy Hook is a hoax used to push support for gun control. In a separate case in 2017, Richards admitted to sending Pozner a threatening message that read, “LOOK BEHIND YOU IT IS DEATH.” She was sentenced to five months in prison followed by three years on supervised release. On the stand this week, Pozner said his two daughters were with him when the voicemails began playing, and he was concerned for their safety. “It said a lot of ugly things. And I felt like I needed to defend my son,” he said on the stand. On the stand, Pozner testified he had been “doing well” – and initially interacting with Sandy Hook deniers to try to defuse the situation. “I had attempted to be transparent. I published Noah’s death certificate on a social media page I used as a memorial page. And after doing that I was accused of being a fake and a fraud and that changed everything,” he said, according to the Wisconsin State Journal. The court heard from Dr Roy Lubit, a forensic psychiatrist, who testified that Pozner’s mental state “went downhill after he was confronted by the denials that it happened”. Fetzer, however, argued that the statements in his book aren’t defamatory “because they’re true” and maintained there was no proof that Pozner’s harassers were inspired by the book. The jury disagreed, finding three of the book’s statements to be defamatory. Fetzer called the damages amount “absurd” and said he would appeal. After the verdict, Pozner thanked the jury “for recognizing the pain and terror that Mr Fetzer has purposefully inflicted on me and on other victims of these horrific mass casualty events, like the Sandy Hook shooting”. Pozner went on say that the case was not about free speech rights. “Mr Fetzer has the right to believe that Sandy Hook never happened,” he said. “He has the right to express his ignorance.” The award, he added, “further illustrates the difference between the right of people like Mr Fetzer to be wrong and the right of victims like myself and my child to be free from defamation, free from harassment and free from the intentional infliction of terror”."

    "title": "How to vote, polling station queues and pencil conspiracy theories - Q&A",
    "content": "How do I find out where to go to vote? If you are registered to vote you will have been sent a polling card, which indicates where you should vote. If you haven’t received a polling card you should contact your local Electoral Registration Office. You can use this service to find the address if you live in England, Scotland or Wales. If you live in Northern Ireland you need to contact the Electoral Office for Northern Ireland (EONI). Do I need ID to vote? You do not need to show ID to vote in England, Scotland and Wales in a general election. You don’t even need to bring your polling card. You just need to tell polling staff your name and address. They will then cross your name off the list and give you a ballot paper. If you’re voting in Northern Ireland, you must show photo ID. What time does voting finish today? Polls close at 10pm, but remember, as long as you are at least in the queue to vote by 10pm, they will let you in to vote. What happens in the polling station? If you haven’t voted before, or for a long time, here’s what you can expect. Once the clerk is assured of who you are with either your polling card, name and address, or ID in Northern Ireland, you will be ticked off a list of registered voters for that polling station. The clerk will then give you a ballot paper. Take the paper into the privacy of a voting booth, and mark an ‘X’ next to the candidate of your choice in the box provided next to their name. Then fold up your paper, and put it into the ballot box. If you make a mistake voting, you can go back to the clerk and ask for another ballot paper, providing you haven’t already put your vote into the ballot box. Why do people sometimes ask me for my polling number after I’ve voted? During an election campaign parties will often go door-to-door asking people how they intend to vote. They’ll keep a list of people who say they will or might vote for them. When party workers ask for your polling number after you’ve voted, it allows them to check whether you are on their list of people to remind to vote, and cross you off, as you already have. It does not in any way tell them how you have voted, but possibly stops them knocking on your door later on when you are having your tea. Do large queues at polling stations mean a large turn-out? Not necessarily. It isn’t unusual for polling stations to be extremely busy at the times that people usually travel to and from work. Turnout has been going back up in recent years after the low of 59.4% in 2001. While lots of people have been posting on social media on Thursday that large queues indicate that young voters are turning out, it should be cautioned that people said the same in 2017 and 2015.\n\nCan I take a selfie when I’m voting? Or post a picture of my ballot paper online? The rules around photography at elections were drawn up long before Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat existed, and are not really prepared for it. The Electoral Commission recommends that returning officers do not allow photography within polling stations. This is because of the secrecy requirements set out in section 66 of the Representation of the People Act. Trying to take pictures inside a busy polling station could be construed as an attempt to obtain information about how other people have voted. So while there is not a specific law against taking a selfie while you vote, it could land you in hot water. Postal ballots are somewhat different. Since the rules around photography are to do with maintaining secrecy in a polling station or polling place, that is not a consideration with postal voting. The Electoral Commission has confirmed that “a postal voter may take a picture of their own postal ballot paper and publicise, including via social media” even if it shows how they have voted. Can I take a picture of my dog at a polling station? Yes. And cats, horses, and even Daleks. Please do. Are ballot papers biased because the Brexit party logo points to where you vote or the Liberal Democrats say ‘stop Brexit’? In May, there were complaints that the European parliamentary election ballot paper contained a subliminal bias, as the Brexit party logo appears to be an arrow pointing to the voting box. The party’s logo is made up of parts of the shape of the “e” and “x” in the middle of Brexit, which leaves an arrow shape in the middle. The Electoral Commission oversees which logos parties use, and its guidelines specify that you are not allowed to use an emblem that “is likely to contradict or hinder instructions or guidance given for voting”. It approved the use of the Brexit party emblem on 4 April this year, not finding that it might influence votes. Parties are also allowed to display a description alongside their name, which is why the Liberal Democrats are allowed to say “to Stop Brexit” on the ballot paper. This also has been approved by the Electoral Commission. Other parties would be free to take a similar approach if they felt it would be beneficial. Why do people say you should ‘use pens’ to vote? There’s a persistent social media myth that it is safer to vote using your own pen than the pencils supplied in polling booths. This is, the conspiracy theory states, to prevent agents from tampering with your vote, by erasing the “x” on your ballot paper and placing it somewhere else. In truth, the logistics of someone arranging to have ballot papers taken away, votes erased and replaced back in the ballot boxes is somewhat fanciful. But there is nothing to stop you bringing your own pen if it makes you feel better."

    "content": "A young Sudanese woman, dressed in white, standing high above a crowd and demanding change.\n\nA fearless Lebanese woman drop-kicking an armed bodyguard in the groin amid anti-corruption protests in Beirut. A teenage girl from Sweden staring down Donald Trump at the UN climate summit. If there is an image that sums up 2019 it may well be a young woman protesting. As strongmen try to take over the world, women have been fighting back and making their voices heard. While it has been a year marked by political upheaval, there’s also been a lot of light relief. We had Hot Girl Summer and Wagatha Christie. Lizzo’s upbeat anthem Truth Hurts became the longest solo female rap No 1 in history. We got a gay Batwoman. And, thanks to Gwyneth Paltrow and her infinite Goopy wisdom, we spent a lot of time discussing whether you should put garlic up your vagina (spoiler: hell no). We also had a lot of firsts. Karen Uhlenbeck became the first woman to be awarded the Abel prize, mathematics’ most prestigious award. Austria appointed its first female chancellor. Missy Elliott became the first female hip-hop artist to be inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame. Fiona Kolbinger became the first woman to win the Transcontinental, a grueling long-distance cycling race. Simone Biles became the most decorated gymnast in history. It’s been a very, very, very long year. To help you look back on it, we’re here with some of the highlights and lowlights. From equal pay protests to spacewalks, here are 10 memorable moments from the year in patriarchy. 1 America waged war on abortion rights Accessing a safe and legal abortion became a lot more fraught in the US this year as numerous conservative states attempted to implement so-called “heartbeat” bills that would effectively ban abortion. While competition is close, Ohio probably wins scariest state of the year, with a bill requiring doctors to “reimplant an ectopic pregnancy”, a medically impossible procedure, or be charged with “abortion murder”. 2020 will be another critical year for reproductive rights in America; Donald Trump has made it clear that pandering to anti-abortion extremists will be a core part of his re-election strategy. 2 Saudi Arabia let (some) women travel In a historic move, Saudi Arabia has relaxed archaic laws that required women to get the permission of a male guardian in order to travel. While the kingdom has been taking small steps forward when it comes to women’s rights, there’s still an enormous way to go. To start with, it could release the women’s rights activists who have been locked up for more than a year and who have been reportedly been tortured. 3 Cat lovers were vindicated by science There is absolutely no basis to the “crazy cat lady” stereotype, according to a very important study done by researchers at University of California, Los Angeles. Rumour has it that the research was paid for by big feline. 4 Astronauts completed first ever all-female spacewalk The extraterrestrial expedition, which took place in October, was originally planned for March but had to be postponed due to a wardrobe malfunction – one of the spacesuits was too big. The giant leap for womankind took place almost 35 years after Svetlana Savitskaya became the first woman to do a spacewalk. 5 Iran allowed women into soccer stadiums for first time in decades In October thousands of Iranian women watched their national soccer team play live after the country overturned a decades-long ban on women in stadiums. Unfortunately it took a tragedy for Fifa to shame Iran into this: a fan known as “Blue Girl” set herself on fire after she was jailed for trying to enter Tehran’s Azadi stadium dressed as a man. She died of her injuries. 6 The Women’s World Cup brought joy – and an equal pay discussion The US women’s soccer team broke records, won fans and became world champions over the summer. Perhaps most impressive of all, however, is the way in which they made the fight for equal pay in sport an urgent talking point and had crowds chanting “Equal pay!” in the stadiums."

On the eve of the scheduled second leg Domínguez had proudly talked up his plans to modernise the competition and make it, if not a rival to the Champions League, then at least a companion for it. The next day the Boca team bus was attacked on the way to the stadium. Players were traumatised. The captain, Pablo Pérez, had to go to hospital to have glass splinters removed from his eye. Others suffered the effects of inhaling pepper spray. The game was postponed for 24 hours and then called off again, shifted to a different continent so the Libertadores final suffered the symbolic indignity of being played in Madrid."

    "title": "Factcheck: Is there really a green conspiracy to stop bushfire hazard reduction?",
    "content": "Large parts of New South Wales have been in the grip of catastrophic fire weather this week as firefighters desperately work to save homes, properties and lives. But as firefighters try and beat back the bushfires, a familiar blame game began with critics pointing fingers at “greenies”, claiming they get in the way of hazard reduction efforts that might have reduced the size and scale of the disaster. “These are very tired and very old conspiracy theories that get a run after most major fires,” says Prof Ross Bradstock, the director of the centre for environmental risk management of bushfires at the University of Wollongong, who has been researching bushfires for 40 years. “They’ve been extensively dealt with in many inquiries.”\n\nSo what are the claims? The chief accuser is Nationals MP Barnaby Joyce who says “greens policy” gets in the way “of many of the practicalities of fighting a fire and managing it”. Among Joyce’s claims, made in several interviews this week, are that Greens policies have made hazard reduction activities more difficult. This claim, just to be clear, is about the policies of a party that has never been in government. Joyce also blamed the Greens for “paperwork” that made it harder to carry out hazard reduction activities. “It’s not burning because they burnt off, it’s burning because they didn’t burn off,” Joyce told SkyNews. According to Bradstock, Joyce’s claims are familiar but “without foundation.” “It’s simply conspiracy stuff. It’s an obvious attempt to deflect the conversation away from climate change.” A former NSW fire and rescue commissioner, Greg Mullins, has written this week that the hotter and drier conditions, and the higher fire danger ratings, were preventing agencies from carrying out prescribed burning. He said: “Blaming ‘greenies’ for stopping these important measures is a familiar, populist, but basically untrue claim.” What is hazard reduction? Preparations for bushfire season are done outside the most dangerous periods using a suite of methods known as hazard reduction. “The fuel is the hazard, so it’s about reducing that fuel load to diminish the intensity of a subsequent wildfire,” Bradstock says. Methods include prescribed burning where authorities identify at-risk areas close to developments, or in areas known for being sites where large fires ignite, and “reduce the load” with controlled burning. In some areas, hazard reduction is carried out by removing trees and vegetation. Another method is to create fuel breaks, also known as fire breaks, where trees are cleared to prevent the spread of a fire to protect developments and infrastructure. This is also done routinely around power lines. It is activities like this which Joyce claims are being suppressed by bureaucracy. Is there a drop in hazard reduction? A spokesperson for the NSW Department of Planning, Industry and Environment has told Guardian Australia that the National Parks and Wildlife Service carried out hazard reduction activities across more than 139,000ha in 2018 and 2019."

    "title": "Study shows 60% of Britons believe in conspiracy theories",
    "content": "Sixty per cent of British people believe at least one conspiracy theory about how the country is run or the veracity of information they have been given, a major new study has found, part of a pattern of deep distrust of authority that has become widespread across Europe and the US. In the UK, people who supported Brexit were considerably more likely to give credence to conspiracy theories than those who opposed it, with 71% of leave voters believing at least one theory compared with 49% of remain voters. Almost half (47%) of leave voters believed the government had deliberately concealed the truth about how many immigrants live in the UK, versus 14% of remain voters. A striking 31% of leave voters believed that Muslim immigration was part of a wider plot to make Muslims the majority in Britain, a conspiracy theory that originated in French far-right circles that was known as the “great replacement”. The comparable figure for remain voters was 6%. The disparities between those who voted for Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton in the US was even more stark, where 47% of Trump voters believed that man-made global warming was a hoax, compared with 2.3% of Clinton voters. The figures were the result of a large-scale international project conducted over six years and in nine countries by researchers at the University of Cambridge and YouGov, funded by the Leverhulme Trust. The study was the most comprehensive examination of conspiracy theories ever conducted, and marks the first time academics have explored questions of conspiracy beliefs, social trust and news consumption habits across different countries. The researchers also found: • 15% of leave voters and 11% of remain voters in Britain believed that, regardless of who was officially in charge in government, the world was run by a secret global cabal of people who control events together. • The most widespread conspiracy belief in the UK, shared by 44% of people, was that “even though we live in what’s called a democracy, a few people will always run things in this country anyway”. • Mistrust of authority was high in the UK, with 77% of people trusting journalists “not much” or “not at all”; 76% distrusting British government ministers; and 74% distrusting company bosses. • Friends and family, by contrast, were trusted by 87% and 89% of respondents respectively, potentially adding credence to news sources shared by social media contacts. • Remain voters were more likely (50%) to use social media regularly for news than leave voters (34%), and more likely to read a newspaper website (by 41% to 18%). Of those who got their news from social media, Facebook was used frequently by more leave voters than remainers (74% leave, 65% remain), while the opposite was true of Twitter (39% remain, 28% leave). • Of the countries surveyed, Sweden was the least credulous of conspiracy theories, with 52% believing one or more of the theories polled by the researchers, as opposed to 85% for Hungary. In the US that figure was 64% and in France 76%. Prof John Naughton, the director of the press fellowship programme at Wolfson College and one of three University of Cambridge professors who led the research, said the study, which began in 2012, had been born out of an attempt to look at the “natural history” of conspiracy theories.\n\nThe researchers had tried to be as broad as possible in their definition of the term as “a theory that some actors have conspired to do something covertly, usually something dysfunctional or evil”. As part of the study, they polled respondents about 10 theories, all of which had emerged from their research, in order to test how widely they were held. “Conspiracy theories are, and as far as we can tell always have been, a pretty important part of life in many societies, and most of the time that has gone beneath the radar of the established media,” said Naughton. “Insofar as people thought of conspiracy theories at all, we thought of them as crazy things that crazy people believed, [and that] didn’t seem to have much impact on democracy.” That dismissive attitude changed after the Brexit vote and the election of Trump in 2016, he said. “Whatever else you think of Trump, he is a born conspiracy theorist. Trump was a kind of catalyst, in that somehow his election had the effect of mainstreaming conspiracy theories.” In fact, the prevalence of conspiracy beliefs in human societies suggests they may have a function, said Naughton. “It’s a way of trying to make sense of a complex and confusing world for an ordinary citizen.” Fewer people, in the UK at least, believed some of the other theories tested by the researchers, including that the official account of the Holocaust was a lie (2%), that human contact with aliens had been hushed up (8%), that the truth about vaccines was being hidden (10%) and that the Aids virus was created and spread on purpose (believed by 4% of Britons, but 12% of French). Dr Hugo Leal, one of the project’s researchers, said he and the other academics had been startled by the proportion of Trump and Brexit supporters who said they believed the grand replacement theory. He said: “This is intertwined with a broader conspiratorial outlook, which seems to link the Trump and Brexit camps. Indeed, both sides share attitudes and sentiments that transcend the mere conservative ideological affiliation. Our study shows that conspiracy theories are a central element to understanding a common political culture, which most scholars find hard to fathom.” Leal described the shared attitudes as a “transatlantic conspiratorial axis”. More than 11,500 people were surveyed online by YouGov across nine countries: France, Germany, the UK, Hungary, Italy, Poland, Portugal, Sweden and the US. The British sample size was 2,171 adults, which was weighted to be representative."

    "title": "Russian spy Maria Butina pleads guilty to conspiracy against US",
    "content": "A 30-year-old former student has become the first Russian national convicted for seeking to influence US politics during the 2016 presidential election. Maria Butina, who built a powerful network that reached into Donald Trump’s circle, tried to infiltrate the influential National Rifle Association (NRA) and relay intelligence on American politicians to a Russian government official.\n\nOn Thursday, at the US district court for the District of Columbia, Butina pleaded guilty to a conspiracy to act as an agent of a foreign government and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors in exchange for less prison time. The prosecutors in the Butina case are not from the office of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russia’s interference in the 2016 election and whether Trump’s campaign conspired with Moscow. Mueller has brought criminal charges against a series of Russian individuals and entities but those cases are still pending. Butina entered the packed courtroom in Washington looking composed but wan. The court heard that solitary confinement has taken a toll on her. Her red hair was pulled back in a long braid. She wore a green jumpsuit with short sleeves; underneath was a white garment that had a hole in the left elbow."

    "title": "Twitter permanently bans conspiracy theorist Alex Jones",
    "content": "One month after it distinguished itself from the rest of the tech industry by declining to bar the rightwing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones from its platform, Twitter fell in line Thursday, permanently banning the accounts of both Jones and his website Infowars. “We took this action based on new reports of Tweets and videos posted yesterday that violate our abusive behavior policy, in addition to the accounts’ past violations,” the company tweeted. “We will continue to evaluate reports we receive regarding other accounts potentially associated with @realalexjones or @infowars and will take action if content that violates our rules is reported or if other accounts are utilized in an attempt to circumvent their ban.”\n\nThe company does not usually comment on individual accounts, but said it “wanted to be open about this action given the broad interest in this case”. The two accounts had about 1.3 million followers combined."

    "title": "Pittsburgh shooting extends wave of conspiracy-minded rightwing violence",
    "content": "The mass shooting at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh comes amid a wave of rightwing violence across the US fuelled by conspiracy theories. It is also part of a long history of white supremacist terror aimed at American Jewish communities.\n\nThe murder of 11 people and wounding of six, allegedly by Robert Bowers, 46, came a day after the arrest of Cesar Sayoc, 56, for a mail bombing campaign that targeted liberals including George Soros. A prominent Jewish billionaire, Soros has in recent weeks been the target of heightened conspiracy-minded rhetoric from prominent Republicans including Donald Trump. A social media post that appeared to be Bowers’ last before the attack was an attack on HIAS, a Jewish-run refugee charity, which he accused of working to “bring invaders in that kill our people”. This belief is in keeping with white supremacist “white genocide” narratives, which hold in part that Jews are orchestrating the “demographic replacement” of white people by means of immigration. It also resembles recent conspiracy-minded comments by mainstream Republicans about the so-called “caravan” of Honduran refugees which is currently hundreds of miles from the US southern border. On 17 October, the Florida congressman Matt Gaetz sent out a tweet that read: “Footage in Honduras giving cash 2 women & children 2 join the caravan & storm the US border @ election time. Soros? US-backed NGOs? Time to investigate the source!” While attempting to explain the tweet, he made a similar charge about Soros and the Balkans. It was also reported last week that the Iowa congressman Steve King had aired white-nationalist style views about demographic replacement in an interview with a far-right Austrian website. On Saturday, Heidi Beirich, director of the Intelligence Project at the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), which monitors hate groups, said Gaetz’s tweet was a “soft version” of the white genocide theory. Beirich added that “sections of the far right, including the president, have fallen into a fever swamp” concerning Soros. Earlier this month, Trump tweeted the assertion that the financier paid activists protesting against the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the supreme court. During the 2016 election, his final campaign ad connected Soros and the then Federal Reserve chair, Janet Yellen, with a supposed “globalist” establishment conspiracy. Beirich said those who deploy such rhetoric “absolutely bear a moral responsibility” for acts of antisemitic violence such as that which took place in Pittsburgh. The Anti-Defamation League (ADL) chief executive, Jonathan A Greenblatt, released a statement on Saturday in which he said the shooting was “likely the deadliest attack on the Jewish community in the history of the United States”. He added that it came at a “time when ADL has reported a historic increase in both anti-Semitic incidents and anti-Semitic online harassment”. The statement pointed to ADL research showing large increases in antisemitic incidents and antisemitic online harassment. Over the last two decades, white supremacists have repeatedly targeted synagogues and other Jewish institutions for vandalism and violent attacks. On 13 April 2014, Frazier Glenn Miller Jr, a neo-Nazi, shot dead three people at a Jewish community center and a retirement home in Overland Park, Kansas. In 2002, Jake Laskey, his brother Gabriel Laskey and two other men threw swastika-engraved rocks at Temple Beth Israel in Eugene, Oregon, during Friday prayers. In 1994, the same synagogue was the target of a drive-by shooting by a member of the neo-Nazi American Front group, which desecrated several synagogues in the 1990s."

    "title": "Doctors urge Queensland to help defeat anti-fluoride 'conspiracy theorists'",
    "content": "The Australian Medical Association says the Queensland government needs to strike a new deal with regional councils to encourage them to put fluoride back in the water supply. About 800,000 people in regional Queensland do not have fluoride added to their drinking water. That represents more than half the population outside of the urban south-east, and 40% of the state’s Indigenous population, who have the highest rates of tooth decay. The AMA Queensland president, Dilip Dhupelia, said the state needed to end the “piecemeal approach” that gave local councils responsibility for deciding whether to add fluoride, which was widely backed by public health experts as a safe and effective way to prevent dental problems. Dhupelia said the situation had led to an impasse in some areas, where councils were willing to consider fluoridation but wanted the state, which owns the water supply, to cover the cost. “There is ample evidence to prove that fluoridation is an affordable and efficient public health prevention method that all Queenslanders deserve,” he said.\n\nDhupelia said this week’s Local Government Association of Queensland conference in Brisbane was an opportunity for the government “to strike a collaborative approach with councillors to covering the cost and infrastructure”. Policies about fluoridation in Queensland have changed several times during the past decade. In 2008 the Bligh government passed the Water Fluoridation Act, which required a dose of fluoride be added to all water supplies serving towns of more than 1,000 people. In 2012 the Newman government amended the act to give local councils the option. Cairns, Rockhampton, Gladstone, Mackay, Bundaberg, Hervey Bay and Maryborough were among about 40 councils that voted to stop fluoridation. The Palaszczuk government and senior public health officials support fluoridation. But the government has consistently said it will not repeal the Newman-era laws and that local councils will remain the ultimate decision-makers. The AMA and Australian Dental Association have in recent months launched public information campaigns in those areas attempting to encourage locals to back fluoridation, citing studies that show significant public health benefits. In 2015, the University of Queensland found the rate of tooth decay among children dropped 19% after fluoride was added to water in the Logan-Beaudesert area. Dhupelia said most councils retained the infrastructure to put fluoride in the water but that some had “succumbed to some ridiculous anti-fluoridation lobbying”. “Councillors must ignore the conspiracy theorists and follow the science: fluoridation combined with good oral hygiene reduces tooth decay by up to 40%,” Dhupelia said. Townsville council estimates the cost of adding fluoride to the water supply is about 60c a year for each resident. The state health minister, Steven Miles, has been approached for comment."

    "title": "Britons are swallowing conspiracy theories. Here’s how to stop the rot | Hugo Drochon",
    "content": "Who believes in conspiracy theories, and why? That is the question asked in a five-year study at Cambridge University, which commissioned three surveys from YouGov (2015, 2016 and 2018) to get a sense of the phenomenon. It turns that out 60% of British people believe in at least one of the 10 conspiracy theories we put to them. So, for instance, 8% think humans have made contact with aliens at Roswell but the US government is hiding it from us; 7% believe that global warming is a hoax invented to deceive people; and 10% agree that the truth about the harmful effects of vaccines is being deliberately hidden from the public.\n\nOn all these counts the British average is lower than its European or American counterpart, but there are two views in particular where it scores higher, and both are related to immigration. “The government is deliberately hiding the truth about how many immigrants really live in this country”, believe 30% of respondents. Muslim immigration is particularly singled out, with 18% agreeing that it is “part of a bigger plan to make Muslims a majority of this country’s population”. Our research reveals that belief in conspiracy theories is linked to two things: a sense of threat, and a feeling of being excluded from power. The sense of threat comes from fears about mass migration: remember Nigel Farage’s “breaking point” poster, which played on fears of Syrian refugees swamping our shores? Being excluded from power comes from a feeling of not being listened to by politicians. The most believed statement in our latest survey was the claim that “even though we live in what’s called a democracy, a few people will always run things in this country anyway” (44%). It is debatable whether that is a conspiracy theory or not – it might just be a true reflection of reality – but combined with the extreme levels of distrust in government (76% distrust ministers) and company bosses (74%), it shows how people feel they are not being heard. Conspiracy theories allow people to regain a sense of control over their lives: they offer a reasoning for all the crazy and inexplicable things that happen in the world, often by seeing them as the secret machinations of a hidden and extremely powerful group of people who control everything (14% believe that “regardless of who is officially in charge of governments and other organisations, there is a single group of people who secretly control events and rule the world together”)."

    "title": "How rightwing conspiracy theorists attacked Christine Blasey Ford's testimony",
    "content": "Conservatives did not stand idle while the FBI completed its limited investigation on Brett Kavanaugh. While this unfolded, Dr Christine Blasey Ford has been subjected to a full-frontal personal attack, which has been taken up by all segments of rightwing media. But while most ostensibly respectable outlets contented themselves with attacks on her credibility, others have leapt headlong into conspiracy theory. The idea that Ford is a deep-cover operative, placed by a hidden hand to destroy Kavanaugh, circulated remarkably quickly and very widely after her identity was revealed by the Washington Post. This only intensified after her testimony before the Senate judiciary committee. This conspiracy thinking was by no means confined to the low-traffic online fringe websites – it was amplified and further disseminated by some of the country’s most prominent rightwing broadcasters. So much so that it once again raised the question of where the border between conspiracy theories and respectable conservative media lies. A tweet by talk radio star Michael Savage – whose show, the Savage Nation, reaches up to 11 million people according to industry website Talkers – last week alleged that Ford was tied to the CIA via her brother, her father, and Stanford University.\n\nSavage claimed that Ford herself ran a CIA internship program at Stanford, that her brother’s former law firm “created” Fusion GPS (originators of the Trump “pee tape” dossier) , that the firm was collocated (and therefore connected) with CIA-aligned companies run by her father, Ralph Blasey Jr, and that her grandfather was a CIA agent named Nicholas Deak. The tweet summarized his argument with a screenshot of an all-caps post from Savage’s blog. This, in turn, was a recapitulation of the case he had yelled at his listeners several times in the days following Ford’s testimony (The Savage Nation, is perennially among the top 10 most listened to radio programs in the country, according to Talkers annual “Heavy 100” survey). He has continued attacking Ford, often using baseless claims, as the country has waited for the FBI to complete its investigation, and for the Senate to vote on Kavanaugh’s nomination. None of the claims Savage made are true, as is painstakingly detailed in a rebuttal at Snopes. Stanford has no CIA internship program; Deak is not Ford’s grandfather; Ralph Blasey III was not working at law firm Baker Hostetler when it worked with Fusion GPS; her father has no relationship with most of the companies mentioned, and the one he does work for has no connection to the CIA. But after Savage gave it a run, the conspiracy theory was, in turn, elaborated on and pitilessly hammered by Alex Jones and Infowars, who have run stories on Ford’s supposed CIA connections, and false allegations about her personal life, for the last week. (Though Jones’s reach has been reduced by social media bans, his website has 4.3 million monthly uniques according to traffic monitor Alexa, and his radio show has almost 6 million weekly listeners.) Savage didn’t originate the theory himself. It appears to have first been floated in a rambling piece on the notorious (and eye-searing) conspiracy site, whatdoesitmean.com, posted the day after her identity was revealed. The post incorporates some familiar tropes and stock characters from conspiracy subculture, like Deak, whose murder at the hands of a homeless woman have long fueled speculation. A writer who goes by Sorcha Faal at whatdoesitmean.com adds some more conspiracy culture red meat by claiming that Ford’s connection to Deak is via a Stanford scientist, Frederick Melges, who Faal claims was engaged in work on the MKUltra mind control program. Were these falsehoods confined to sites like this, it would only be of interest to those with a yen for subcultural arcana. But these lies then spread through better-read conspiracy sites like Zero Hedge, who called Ford a “CIA honeytrap”. Wherever Savage read it, thanks to him and Jones, millions of Americans have heard, and perhaps believed, that Ford only came forward with her accusations because of a “deep state” plot against Kavanaugh, and by extension the president. Other conspiracy theories about Ford have proliferated, some even more fantastical than the one Savage mainstreamed. The influential anti-feminist and white nationalist blog Chateau Heartiste amplified theories that Ford was an FBI asset. And as reported on Right Wing Watch, conspiracy broadcaster Rick Wiles suggested that Ford was a sleeper agent whose conditioning was triggered by the use of the word “lodestar” in the op-ed by an anonymous administration official which was published by the New York Times. The trajectory of these falsehoods shows how quickly and broadly conspiracy theories about crucial political stories can now proliferate. The alacrity with which Savage seized on them also suggests that they have become part of the rapid-response armory for the political right. Kate Starbird, who analyses disinformation networks at the University of Washington, says conspiracy thinking is more evident on the left and the right. She says that, as in the Ford case, “one of the things that disinformation does is to try to discredit opposition sources”. Starbird says that increasingly conspiracy theories “start from the ground up and are taken up by conservative media elites”, like high-profile broadcasters. “That means they can reach a mass of people.” She says it is hard to measure whether conspiracy theories are becoming more widespread, but “most troubling is that they are beginning to get into the minds of people in power”. Starbird points to General Michael Flynn’s penchant for spreading multiple conspiracy theories. And just this morning, Donald Trump continued his long history of promoting conspiracy theories when he blamed the Hungarian-American billionaire George Soros for the protests against the Kavanaugh confirmation at the US Senate. (Soros is frequently the focus of conspiracy theories, many of which have antisemitic overtones.) So why do masses of ordinary people believe such convoluted tales? Starbird’s explanation is appealingly simple: “People want to believe in their side of politics. They grab on to evidence that can support the things they believe. Conspiracy theories can help explain things in a way that aligns with their worldview.” For many on the fringe, and increasingly for broadcasters like Savage – a bestselling author, a Trump confidant, and an inductee to the Radio Hall of Fame – lies about Ford are more palatable than the idea that she is telling the truth about Brett Kavanaugh. Influential broadcasters – whether from cynicism, credulousness, or a blend of the two – now readily spread outlandish theories in order to quiet the clanging cognitive dissonance of a particularly gullible, or committed mass of rightwing Americans. Anything, it seems, is preferable to the thought that one’s party, and one’s president, might be knowingly promoting an abuser to the highest court in the land."

    "title": "Facebook suspends US conspiracy theorist Alex Jones",
    "content": "Alex Jones, the American conspiracy theorist who runs the InfoWars website, has been suspended from Facebook for bullying and hate speech. The suspension will last for 30 days, and affects only Jones’s personal account on the social network, not the main InfoWars account. His profile will continue to be published, but he will not be not be able to post content until the suspension elapses. A Facebook spokesperson told the Guardian Jones was found to have violated its community standards. “Our community standards make it clear that we prohibit content that encourages physical harm [bullying], or attacks someone based on their religious affiliation or gender identity [hate speech],” the spokesperson said. “We remove content that violates our standards as soon as we’re aware of it. In this case, we received reports related to four different videos on the pages that InfoWars and Alex Jones maintain on Facebook. We reviewed the content against our community standards and determined that it violates. All four videos have been removed from Facebook.” The suspension means Jones will not be able to post content to pages for which he is a “page admin”. As the suspension applies only to Jones personally, the channel bearing his name on Facebook will remain active, as will InfoWars itself, which has several page administrators. The intention is to prevent individuals from working around the ban by using multiple pages to violate policy. According to a Facebook source, Jones had previously been warned that he had repeatedly violated the company’s policies, and told that the next time he did so he would be suspended for 30 days. Facebook has previously been accused of “light-touch” moderation for high-profile accounts, even if they seem to be repeatedly violating policies. Earlier this month, Channel 4 revealed, through undercover filming, that some accounts, including those of far-right icons such as Tommy Robinson and Britain First, were marked as “shielded” and prevented from deletion even when normal users would have faced action. The company had faced calls to take down InfoWars, which is infamous for promoting the conspiracy theory that the Sandy Hook school shooting never happened, and that grieving parents were “crisis actors” trying to drive an anti-gun agenda. Facebook’s head of news feed has previously argued that “just being false” does not violate community standards, and a company spokesperson later added that “we just don’t think banning pages for sharing conspiracy theories or false news is the right way to go”. Earlier this week, YouTube removed four videos from the InfoWars channel – understood to be the same content that led to the Facebook action – and issued a “strike” against InfoWars for its conduct. It was the second such strike the channel had received, but although YouTube officially bans accounts when they receive three strikes, the strikes time out after 90 days. Additionally, the channel bundles multiple violations into individual strikes, protecting Jones from a potential ban. Accounts that are subject to a content strike are not able to stream live on YouTube until the strike expires, but Jones is still a regular presence on the site: he is simply hosting his livestreams on other channels, donated by friends and supporters, forcing YouTube to ban those streams as it finds them. Earlier this week, Jones broadcast a rant against Robert Mueller, the US special counsel investigating Donald Trump’s connections to Russia, fantasising about shooting him and accusing him without evidence of paedophilia. “It’s not a joke. It’s not a game. It’s the real world. Politically. You’re going to get it, or I’m going to die trying, bitch. Get ready. We’re going to bang heads,” Jones said, miming firing a gun repeatedly."

    "title": "Fake moon landings and a flat Earth: why do athletes love conspiracy theories?",
    "content": "With Christmas Day just gone, it seems fitting that Steph Curry already has something he’d probably like to take back. Two weeks ago, the Golden State Warriors star gave the 24-hour news cycle an incredible gift during an appearance on The Ringer’s Winging It podcast. The show, which features the Atlanta Hawks’ Vince Carter and Kent Bazemore as hosts, styles itself as more of a hang session than a proper interview; the point is to give listeners a sense of conversations that players actually have when scoop-hungry reporters aren’t parsing their every word. For 70 minutes the Warriors sharpshooter played along as Carter recalled his experience playing with Curry’s father, Dell. Had you zoned out around the 45-minute mark, you may have missed the playful digression about dinosaurs sounds (“A bone don’t tell you what a sound is,” one player quips) that prompted Curry to suggest that the 1969 moon landing (and the five others that followed) never happened. Clearly, CNN’s forthcoming Apollo 11 documentary can’t get here fast enough for them. The blowback to Curry’s throwaway thought was swift and strong. Nick Gurol, the Philadelphia science teacher who had pushed back against Kyrie Irving after the Boston Celtics standout claimed – while appearing on another NBA players’ podcast in early 2017, incidentally – that the world is flat, was crying foul all over again. Former Nasa spaceman José Hernández accused Curry of promoting “idiotic conspiracy theories.” But not all the reactions to Curry’s astronomical gaffe were so harsh (at worst, maybe it disqualifies him from starring in the long-rumored sequel to Space Jam…). Nasa administrator Jim Bridenstine mostly laughed off Curry’s remarks: “I can’t imagine he really believes that,” he told TMZ. Nasa invited Curry on a tour of its Houston lunar lab, while retired astronaut Scott Kelly, who spent a record 520 days in space, visited with Curry and stressed the importance of scientific literacy. Ultimately, Curry apologized for his comments – which, he strained to note, were “obviously” made in jest. But his contrition didn’t sit well with Irving, who had only just walked back his flat-Earth claims in October. “There’s world hunger going on, there are political things going on,” Irving told a gaggle of beat reporters. “There are so many higher things on the totem pole of society that matter to human beings. But, hey, Curry says he doesn’t believe in the moon [landings]? It’s on CNN. And they say we’re just jocks, we’re just athletes. But it’s on your channel. We’re [thinkers] but you don’t want us to be that.” It used to be that conspiracy theorists hewed to a type. They wore tinfoil hats, babbled incoherently to themselves and, by and large, were little more than a nuisance to the onlookers with the curiosity or the compassion to engage them. But in the current post-truth era, where crowdsourced information has replaced peer-reviewed research and confirmation bias stands in for intellectual curiosity, the truthers congregate online to double down on old conspiracy theories (like the Earth being flat) and breathe life into new ones (like Hillary Clinton being a lizard person). Science can’t hold a candle to celebrity, and sports personalities seem keener than ever to stir the pot. The past year alone has seen ex-NFL tailback Reggie Bush trade anti-vax views with his 2.88 million Twitter followers, retired All-Star pitcher Curt Schilling dismiss one of the victims of the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School as a crisis actor, and even the former England cricket all-rounder Freddie Flintoff joined the flat-Earth movement. And while Irving – whose comments some say are satire anyway –is right to point out that there are more pressing matters to consider than whatever far-out notions that he and his fellow sports celebrities kick around in their safe spaces, he and Curry should know better than anyone the weight that their endorsements carries. If sports heroes can sell sneakers and sugar water, odds are they can pretty much sell anything. When the Seattle Seahawks’ Pete Carroll was reported to have confronted a former US Army general with popular 9/11 conspiracy theories, those truthers cheered the Super Bowl-winning coach for boosting their credibility. It makes you wonder how big the John Birch Society might be today if their commie-fighting followers on the 1984 Padres pitching staff had come along 25 years later.\n\nAnd if some of these ideas haven’t spoiled your family gatherings this holiday season, well, just give it time. Dr James Davis, an associate professor of psychology at Benedictine University, chalks up these flights of fancy to the human propensity to make meaning. “An evolutionary advantage to humans is that we are able to make causal links between events,” he tells the Guardian. “Our brains are so adept at this that oftentimes we will make causal links that don’t exist.” And when sports heroes do this, their young admirers are most likely to receive their conclusions as gospel. Gurol, the Philly science teacher, reckons “anywhere from half to 75%” of his class would believe “whatever [Curry] says.” It’s not just kids. Sports fans are another captive audience with an overactive imagination. Under the right circumstances, they could believe anything: that the NFL triggered the power outage that delayed Super Bowl XVLII to inject life into a game that was quickly turning into a blowout (“Ahh, Roger Goodell,” Ravens linebacker Terrell Suggs told ESPN, “he always has something up his sleeve…); that a heavily favored New Zealand side was intentionally given food poisoning before the 1995 Rugby World Cup final, paving the way for South Africa’s breakthrough victory; that Sonny Liston took a dive against Muhammad Ali in 1965; that NBA commissioner David Stern rigged the 1985 draft for the struggling New York Knicks with a chilled envelope. Anytime things go against one rooting interest or the other, there must be an explanation. There must be a real story that just needs to be uncovered."

    "content": "Combing over the newly released files on the assassination of John F Kennedy, as so many are now doing, may answer some important questions about an event that shocked the world and still fascinates it more than half a century on. But it will spark many more – and not only because some documents were held back at the last moment (what are they trying to hide?). Conspiracy theories are flourishing in democracies as never before. They resist both counter-proof and persuasion because their appeal is primarily emotional. They posit an underlying order that is, on some level, reassuring – hence their proliferation after the sudden deaths of powerful, glamorous figures such as JFK or Diana, Princess of Wales. The system may be malign, but at least it is not random. If only it can be properly exposed, these evils may even be overcome. It may take mental acrobatics to fit the theory to the facts, but there is still a clarity lacking in the muddiness and opacity of real life. A theory of everything holds Freemasons or lizard-people responsible for all that goes wrong. A plot reassures us we are not at the mercy of the interaction of complex and often random forces. A delightful sense of superiority bolsters these stories – you have understood a truth that others are too naive to see, or too corrupt to admit. They often play to existing prejudices, notably antisemitism.\n\nBut these ideas can be more rational than their baroque surfaces suggest. Some conspiracy theories prove true. Others are underpinned by truths: JFK had many enemies; parts of the state were secretly smearing political enemies, overthrowing democratically elected governments elsewhere and assassinating leaders; there was a cover-up. Social media and its echo chambers mean such theories are more visible and rapidly spread than ever. The consequences can be pernicious: ask the bereaved parents of Sandy Hook, hounded with death threats by those convinced the massacre was staged by actors. And while there have been periods when theorising has peaked before, the problem this time may be endemic. Research has previously suggested that conspiracy theories are for losers – literally. Claims that the president is secretly a communist gain ground among Republicans when Democrats are in the White House; stories about Republican wrongdoing advance among out-of-power Democrats. But David Runciman, co-director of the Conspiracy and Democracy project at Cambridge University, warns that the issue now is not the volume of conspiratorial theories but their spread across the political spectrum, from left to right, and their exploitation by democratically elected politicians as well as authoritarian regimes. Donald Trump aggressively promoted the idea of elites manoeuvring against the masses. Such explanations divert blame to a scapegoat, confuse the issue or simply distract from more obvious sins. They are as useful in power as on the campaign trail. Lies and distortions spread via social media undermine democracies; but they are more of a symptom than a cause. Even nonsensical populist fables have a kind of logic at their core. Research by YouGov for the Conspiracy and Democracy project suggests that people who are politically and socio-economically excluded are the most likely to believe conspiracy theories and that such beliefs have less sway in more equal societies. It is increasingly obvious that democratic politics fails to live up to its promises and that the world is indeed controlled to a large extent by elites who defend or expand their riches and power. Wealth is at its most concentrated since the US Gilded Age. Oxfam has revealed that eight people own the same wealth as half the worldAddressing these deeper problems is the best way to root out conspiracy theories. Until then, they are likely to thrive – legitimate grounds of anger becoming diluted into a paranoid search for the missing link, as Professor Runciman puts it. You might almost think someone was trying to distract you."

As far as I know he watches quite a lot of these videos, as I often come round to his place after work to find him glued to the screen. I don’t enjoy watching them, and I’ve asked him if he can possibly watch them when I’m not around.

    "title": "Trump attacks senator and dismisses sexual harassment claims as Democratic conspiracy",
    "content": "Donald Trump claimed on Tuesday that the harassment accusations against him were a Democratic conspiracy as he lashed out at a prominent female senator with what she quickly dubbed a “sexist smear”.\n\n“Lightweight Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, a total flunky for Chuck Schumer and someone who would come to my office ‘begging’ for campaign contributions not so long ago (and would do anything for them), is now in the ring fighting against Trump,” the president tweeted. Gillibrand – who along with three male Democratic senators has called on Trump to resign over the numerous sexual misconduct accusations against him – responded on Twitter minutes later. “You cannot silence me or the millions of women who have gotten off the sidelines to speak out about the unfitness and shame you have brought to the Oval Office,” the New York senator wrote. Hours later, Gillibrand told reporters on Capitol Hill that Trump’s post was “a sexist smear attempting to silence my voice. It’s part of the president’s effort at name-calling.” She added: “I will not be silenced on this issue. Neither will the women who stood up to the president yesterday, and neither will the millions of women who have been marching since the women’s march [in January] to stand up against policies they do not agree with.” Trump singled out Gillibrand while ignoring the male senators who have also called on him to step down: the Vermont senator Bernie Sanders, the New Jersey senator Cory Booker and the Oregon senator Jeff Merkley. The White House press secretary, Sarah Sanders, denied there were any sexual implications behind Trump’s tweet, telling reporters: “Only if your mind is in the gutter would you have read it that way. “This is the same sentiment the president has expressed many times before when he has exposed corruption of the entire political system,” Sanders said. “This isn’t a new sentiment. This isn’t new terminology. “He’s not alleging anything,” she added. “There’s no way that this is sexist at all.” But the tweet drew swift condemnation from Democrats for its provocative innuendo, particularly against the backdrop of a national dialogue around sexual harassment against women. Elizabeth Warren, a Democratic senator from Massachusetts, accused Trump of trying to “slut-shame” Gillibrand. “Are you really trying to bully, intimidate and slut-shame @SenGillibrand?” Warren wrote on Twitter. “Do you know who you’re picking a fight with? Good luck with that, @realDonaldTrump.”"

    "content": "Mike Cronk was sitting half-naked on a street corner, hands covered in blood, when the TV news reporter approached. The 48-year-old, who had used his shirt to try to plug a bullet wound in his friend’s chest, recounted in a live interview how a young man he did not know had just died in his arms. Cronk’s story of surviving the worst mass shooting in modern US history went viral, but many people online weren’t calling him a hero. On YouTube, dozens of videos, viewed by hundreds of thousands of people, claimed Cronk was an actor hired to play the part of a victim in the Las Vegas mass shooting on 1 October.\n\nConspiracy theorists harassed him on Facebook, sending messages like “How much did they pay you?” and “How does it feel to be part of a hoax?” The claims multiplied and soon YouTube’s algorithm began actively promoting the conspiracy theory. Two months later, Cronk’s online reputation appears damaged beyond repair. Type “Mike Cronk” into Google and YouTube, and the sites automatically suggest searches for “actor” and “fake”, leading to popular videos claiming he and his wounded friend were performers and that the Mandalay Bay tragedy that killed 58 people never happened."

    "title": "Teenagers charged with conspiracy to murder after counter-terrorism arrest",
    "content": "Two 14-year-old boys have been charged with conspiracy to murder after they were arrested by counter-terror police. The teenagers, from the market town of Northallerton, North Yorkshire, were arrested on Saturday by the north-east counter-terrorism unit. Both were charged with conspiracy to murder, and one faces another charge of aggravated burglary. They are due to appear in custody at Leeds magistrates court on Thursday. Detectives had been granted extra time to question the boys after they were detained on suspicion of hatching a terror plot. Police raided three residential addresses, including the boys’ homes, over the weekend relating to what police believe was an isolated incident. Northallerton school, a small state school in the town, has become the focus of the investigation, according to parents of pupils, who have claimed there were fears for the safety of staff and children. Phil Cain, the assistant chief constable of North Yorkshire police, said: “Officers believe that this is an isolated incident and the wider community are not at risk. We appreciate the cooperation of local residents whilst the investigation continues.” A spokesman for North Yorkshire county council said: “Northallerton school is supporting the police in their investigation. Police continue to investigate with an open mind to establish what, if any, offences have been committed. “The school understands that parents and carers may have concerns as a result of these arrests. We would like to reassure them that the safety of the school is paramount and we are working with the police to support our students and prioritise their safety at all times.” The teenagers were interviewed on suspicion of preparing for an act of terrorism under section five of the Terrorism Act 2006 after intense police activity in Northallerton."

And the internet loves nothing more than a conspiracy theory. Here is a selection of controversial claims that the web especially seems to love. Modern flat Earth theorists It is not entirely clear whether there is a new generation of people on the web who really believe the Earth is flat, or whether it is being posted as an ironic wind-up, but flat Earth theory has been enjoying a renaissance not seen since, well, perhaps the renaissance itself.\n\nMaintaining that the world is flat is a lot harder in an era where space exploration has sent back images of the planet, and you have to find a way to account for how GPS signals work, but there is still a lot of effort put into it. Just remember though, rumours that the Flat Earth Society once announced it had members all around the globe are sure to have been exaggerated."

    "title": "YouTube alters search algorithm over fake Las Vegas conspiracy videos",
    "content": "YouTube has made changes to its algorithms after it was strongly condemned for promoting offensive and false conspiracy theory videos about the Las Vegas shooting. The move to shift the way it delivers search results contradicts YouTube’s earlier statements defending its performance during breaking news. After a gunman inside the Mandalay Bay hotel fired on a music festival, killing 58 people and injuring hundreds more, videos claiming that the shooting was a hoax and a “false flag” spread like wildfire on YouTube, earning millions of views.\n\nA “Las Vegas shooting” search on the Google-owned platform led users to numerous videos questioning whether the government was lying about the basic facts of the tragedy and suggesting victims could be “actors”. On Wednesday, a YouTube spokesperson insisted the site was highlighting reputable videos and said conspiracy videos the Guardian discovered on its search page did not violate its standards. But less than 24 hours later the company altered its position, implementing changes to its platform in a direct effort to better promote reputable sources. A YouTube source confirmed on Thursday that the company tweaked its search algorithms late on Wednesday night, hours after survivors and victims’ relatives criticised the company for prominently featuring videos with hoax claims. YouTube had been working on this change for months and decided to push it out early this week, the source said. It is unclear how the new algorithm functions or whether it is effective in downgrading falsified accounts of the attack. YouTube declined to answer questions about the changes, which were first reported in the Wall Street Journal. YouTube’s initial statements, followed by its readjusted algorithms, speak to the broader ethical challenges technology companies face regarding their role in providing major platforms for fake news and propaganda. Facebook and Google were both caught promoting rightwing blogs and conspiracy sites hours after the Las Vegas shooting, forcing the corporations to admit that they had made mistakes in spreading misinformation about the identity of the shooter. Silicon Valley has faced heightened scrutiny over the last year for allowing political propaganda and fake news to reach wide audiences, possibly playing a part in Russia’s efforts to interfere with the US presidential election."

Swooping in with an incredible 19,926 votes, of a total of almost 150,000, the Australian magpie took the title, having quietly gained ground over the white ibis (19,083), which had a commanding early lead. The campaign was notable for fierce opinions both for and against the ibis, and many illustrations of its controversial urban habits.\n\nThe competition was complicated by attempted vote-rigging, drama and political intrigue. On the morning of 21 November hundreds of suspicious votes were recorded for the powerful owl. Further investigation identified automated voting, forcing a large number of votes to be removed."

    "title": "Hughie Fury’s defeat by Joseph Parker marred by ‘conspiracy’ claims",
    "content": "Hughie Fury’s failure to dislodge the WBO world heavyweight champion Joseph Parker in his first major fight was accompanied by such passionate wailing from his supporters that he left the Manchester Arena a wounded king rather than a fallen prince. Perversely, the young Mancunian’s reputation is enhanced rather than diminished. That will be minor comfort to him, however, given Parker is now perfectly placed to pursue much bigger nights: against the winner of the putative rematch between Tony Bellew and David Haye, followed by a mega-fight next summer against Anthony Joshua. There is also the prospect of fighting Deontay Wilder, the unbeaten American knockout artist.\n\nThat was the lingering bruise from this setback for Fury: the lost chance to take the place on the world stage vacated by his cousin, Tyson, the semi-retired former champion whose title Parker brought to town – and left with, as well. The World Boxing Organisation crown is a minor one, but it leads to greater riches. Fury’s promoter, Mick Hennessy, was incandescent after two of the three judges returned scores of 118-110 against him, alongside a 114-114 call which was closer to the mark, and spoke vehemently but without proof of “corruption at the highest level in boxing”. He said a rematch was “a worst-case scenario”, adding: “I’m going to get that overturned. I’m going to find out who’s behind boxing [decisions] like that. I know [corruption] is a strong word, but I tell you now, there are forces at work around this game.” Hennessy said there was “100%, definitely” an agenda against the Fury family. The challenger’s father and trainer, Peter, joined Hennessy in his indignation, although he was not so confident that lawyers would get them a result. However, as Parker’s experienced trainer, Kevin Barry, said: “Hughie’s a smart guy, a very good boxer, and his time will come again, at the age of 23. Hughie will fight for the title again, no doubt about it.” The fight was close. Parker was the hunter throughout, frustrated and outboxed in the first half of the contest but more effective in the latter stages, while Fury boxed with high concentration levels on the back foot, sniping intelligently from good angles with light jabs and occasional short right-hand counters off the ropes. But he never properly took command of the fight. The Guardian had Parker winning the first round and the last six. Fury took four of the middle rounds, with one even. While his father said he was kind in giving, “three or four rounds” to the champion, he also admitted: “[Fury] could have done more with the right hand, coming across. I kept telling him, ‘Put more right hands over.’ When he did throw it, he looked good doing it.” The fighter would only say later: “I’ve done all my talking.” Parker, however, was happy to give his take on what he considered a good win. “I put on a lot of pressure and landed some big shots. It was a close fight, but I thought I came out on top. Hughie didn’t hurt me. He was awkward and different. His movement was good, so I give him credit there, but he didn’t have power. His jab was very soft, pitter-patter. But he used it well to move around and to avoid some big shots. That’s why I was chasing him for 12 rounds. There were a few stages where he was a bit dazed, but he did well to recover and keep moving.” The problem was, as good as he looked, Fury did not pull the trigger often enough, especially in the later rounds. That allowed the judges to give the New Zealander the tighter rounds on aggression alone. Fury Sr claimed Barry told him in the ring immediately afterwards the decision was “a robbery”, but that is not how the former Olympic silver medallist recalled it. “No, I said to him the 118-110 was a little large for me and it was a really good fight. He said: ‘I’m pleased you came here to the UK and got a fair go.’ I said: ‘Yes, we thank you very much for that.’ He said: “Let’s have a beer later on,’ and I said ‘OK’.” Regardless of the conflicting interpretations and nuances, the deeper concern was with the unspecified “agenda” against the Fury family, with neither perpetrator nor detail identified. All Fury Sr would say was, “I’ve got an idea why the decision’s gone against him, but I’m not going to make that public. I’ll speak to Mick about it. But we will look to go another route.” Wherever that leads, there is a lot of fight in young Hughie Fury yet."

    "title": "A conspiracy against Labour would not be new | Letters",
    "content": "There is no need for extremists to launch a coup against a Corbyn government as Owen Jones suggests (In No 10, Corbyn would face his own very British coup, 10 August); the kind of half-arsed ex-public schoolboys in the army who once talked of exercising their right to rule have long since shown in the case of the Bullingdon Club that they can take over by due process. For the UK’s rightwing coup took place a long time ago. The successful postwar mixed economy/welfare state with collective bargaining, demand management and nationalised industries, at its most developed under the Conservative Macmillan, was replaced without popular consent about the time that the American government under Nixon ran out of money over Vietnam and could not honour its international settlement commitments to other countries “through the gold window” in 1971, leading to international currencies being made to float, with the US instituting austerity policies to curb inflation. Enoch Powell had told an audience in Chippenham in 1968 that establishment conspiracies were already afoot to convince the public (and the unions!) that “the trade unions are responsible, wholly or partly for rising prices and the falling value of money”, and since then the political establishment and competitive exchange rates have continued to repress any pre-1971 features of the British economy. DBC Reed Northampton • Is Owen Jones jealous of Jonathan Freedland and his alter ego, Sam Bourne? In his column Owen claims the establishment would clobber Corbyn and halt his agenda. Is Owen market–testing plot lines for a nascent novel? One might say it’s Trumpian in its analysis. Drain the Whitehall swamp! Where were these malevolent mandarins when Blair and Brown taxed the banks and spent on social programmes? Owen looks to “a formidable and permanently mobilised movement” to overcome these challenges (presumably as long as they agree with Corbyn). What’s the resolution of Owen’s novel, tragedy or triumph? Will the sainted leader change his views or sell out the “enthusiastic and inspired grassroots” for his purist, protectionist principles? Don’t give up the day job, Owen. Bob Nicholson Frodsham, Cheshire • I do not think that Owen Jones wears a tinfoil hat. However, the civil service has loyally served more radical Labour governments than Wilson’s second term. When Ramsay MacDonald’s 1924 government came to power there was widespread fear in Britain of a Bolshevik revolution, Labour had yet to prove that it could form a responsible government, and many believed the civil service, armed forces and City of London would be stripped bare by punitive measures. Nonetheless, Labour was ably served by the civil service until the government’s collapse. If the civil service does have prejudices, they are well hidden; and not necessarily rightwing. Harry Penfold Hastings, East Sussex • The opposition to a Corbyn government from some quarters will be fierce, but I doubt if it will be monolithic. I was a trader in the City of London for 30 years and I maintain many contacts with City hotshots. They have all either read Piketty or, at least, understand his message, and most of them recognise the obvious truth in what he says. They may be wealthy, privileged even, but they are not at all happy with gross examples of inequality on the Rich List scale, and are alarmed by the oceans of debt and of funny money, created out of thin air by quantitative easing, sloshing about the system. Their children are not going to be immune from problems caused by global warming, pollution, pandemics and a shortage of fresh water, fertile land, minerals etc. The current system prevents any effective agency being formed to deal with these problems. An injection of democracy and a dose of redistribution in the form of increased taxes on the very wealthy and spending on infrastructure and social services might be just what many operators in the capitalist system understand is necessary to create a sustainable future. Peter Robbins London • Owen Jones has a point. At the next election we shall need to be prepared for Tory warnings that a falling pound, economic Armageddon and corporate titans threatening to leave these shores would result from a Labour government. So, here’s an idea: how about if we point out that these elements of catastrophic failure have already been achieved. And without any help from anyone of even the mildest leftwing inclination. The party of the establishment has managed it all by itself. How ironic that they should embody their own worst fears and not even notice the fact. David Thomas Hereford"

    "title": "The hygge conspiracy | Charlotte Higgins",
    "content": "Inescapably and suddenly, Britain has been invaded by hygge. The Danish word, previously unknown to all but the most hardcore Scandophiles, is now the subject of an avalanche of books, hundreds of Identikit newspaper features, and endless department-store winter displays. Every story on the subject explains that the word defies literal translation, before offering “cosiness” as a workable approximation – it’s not exactly that, but rather, a feeling of calm togetherness and the enjoyment of simple pleasures, perhaps illuminated by the gentle flicker of candlelight. Not the least of the paradoxes of this craze, which you might also call a wildly overhyped trend, is that simply pronouncing it is almost impossible for British tongues. The first mention of hygge in any text – where it sits so invitingly on the page, with its row of curvaceous descenders – usually comes with a phonetic guide. This is in order to prevent readers from committing the faux-pas of uttering “higgy” or “huggy” – or, worse, “hig”. “Hue-gah”, “hoo-gah”, “heurgh” and “hhyooguh” are among the approximations offered in the (at least) nine books on hygge published this autumn. (The Sun, helpfully, suggests it should rhyme with “cougar”.) The titles of these books, carefully calibrated for search-engine optimisation, are: Hygge: The Danish Art of Happiness; The Little Book of Hygge: The Danish Way to Live Well; Hygge: A Celebration of Simple Pleasures, Living the Danish Way; The Cozy Life: Rediscover the Joy of Simple Things Through the Danish Concept of Hygge; Hygge: The Complete Guide to Embracing the Danish Concept of Cosy and Simple Living; The Art of Hygge: How to Bring Danish Cosiness Into Your Life; How to Hygge: the Secrets of Nordic Living; The Book of Hygge: The Danish Art of Living Well; Keep Calm and Hygge: A Guide to the Danish Art of Simple and Cosy Living.\n\n“It is the most striking publishing trend I can remember, in terms of the sheer number of titles published at the same time,” Caroline Sanderson, who writes about non-fiction for the Bookseller magazine, told me. And so, inevitably, there is also a 10th book – a parody. Its publication was announced only 29 days after the first of the straight books came out. Say Ja to Hygge: How to Find Your Special Cosy Place suggests that the crucial word be pronounced “huhhpg-ghuhrr”. This is not the only occasion when the parody is hard to distinguish from the volumes it is apparently spoofing. Just as “chic” is the thing that everyone knows about the French, the word hygge must now be affixed, almost by law, to any media story about Denmark or, indeed, anything remotely Scandinavian, whether the subject is clothes, furniture, cookery, travel, or working hours. The headlines are mostly absurd. Get Hygge With It! Hungry For Hygge! Ten Reasons to Hygge … It Will Make You Happier, Fitter and Slimmer! Give Your Home a Hygge! There is even a New Statesman article titled The Hygge of Oasis: Why I Find This Band Strangely Comforting. According to this now vast popular literature, the creation of an atmosphere of hygge is aided by gløgg (mulled wine), meatballs and cardamom buns. Certain activities and entertainments, often involving candles, woollens, or nature, are also said to promote feelings of hygge. One of the less sophisticated books suggests projects for making “winter bunting” and a “mug cosy”, the latter to be fashioned from buttons, sequins and an old sock. Its advice to take up the hyggelig activity of cycling is accompanied by a motivational quote from that byword of existential contentment, Sylvia Plath. I have seen hygge used to sell cashmere cardigans, wine, wallpaper, vegan shepherd’s pie, sewing patterns, a skincare range, teeny-tiny festive harnesses for dachshunds, yoga retreats and a holiday in a “shepherd’s hut” in Kent. The Royal and Derngate Theatre in Northampton has even opened a Bar Hygge – craft beer and open sandwiches a speciality. “It’s hard to pinpoint a definition for the Danish word ‘hygge’,” proclaims the website. “It sits somewhere between warmth and comfort, cosiness and friendship, making the most of every moment, away from worries. We wanted to borrow some of that and bring it to Northampton.” Hygge has been listed as a “word of the year” by both the Collins and Oxford dictionaries – alongside Brexit and Trumpism – in the lexicographers’ annual public-relations exercise. Tremblings of a hygge backlash, seen in skits such as a Daily Mash piece titled Hygge Is Byllshytte, serve only to emphasise its ubiquity. The Eurosceptic Daily Telegraph ran an article suggesting that readers adopt a “bracingly British” version of the trend – brygge."

    "content": "The man who brought a gun into a pizza restaurant to “self-investigate” a series of fake news stories was charged Monday with four offenses, including assault with a deadly weapon and carrying a pistol without a license. The US attorney’s office for the District of Columbia also charged Edgar Welch, 28, of Durham, North Carolina with the unlawful discharge of a firearm and carrying a rifle or a shotgun outside a home or place of business. He is being detained until a preliminary hearing in DC superior court on Thursday.\n\nOn Sunday afternoon, Welch walked into Comet Ping Pong, a popular pizza spot in the Chevy Chase neighborhood, wielding a shotgun and fired three shots, according to the charging documents. Comet has been part of a bizarre fake news conspiracy that drew unsubstantiated links between the Hillary Clinton campaign and a fictitious child sex ring, which the stories said were being run from secret tunnels beneath the restaurant."

    "content": "US police have arrested a man wielding an assault rifle who entered a pizza restaurant that was the target of fake news reports it was operating a child abuse ring led by Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and her top campaign aide. An unidentified 35-year-old man was being held for questioning after police were called to the Comet Ping Pong restaurant in Washington near the Maryland border, said Aquita Brown, a spokeswoman for the Metropolitan Police Department in the nation’s capital.\n\nThe suspect entered the restaurant and pointed a gun at a restaurant employee, who fled and notified authorities, police said. The man then discharged the weapon inside the restaurant. There were no injuries. Two weapons were found inside the restaurant and a third one was recovered from the man’s vehicle, police added. They said the suspect during an interview with investigators revealed that he came to the establishment to “self-investigate” Pizzagate, the police statement said. Pizzagate is a baseless conspiracy, which falsely claims Clinton and her campaign chief John Podesta were running a child sex ring from the restaurant’s backrooms. Police said there was no active investigation of child abuse allegations relating to the restaurant. A Reuters witness at the restaurant with his one-year-old child said it was crowded when the gunman entered, with many families dining. Last month, various media outlets, including the Washington Post and New York Times, reported on internet postings that had sparked death threats against the owner of the restaurant. The attack on Comet was considered an example of how fake news reports that proliferated during the election year impacted people’s lives."

    "title": "Russian official admits to 'institutional conspiracy' of doping Olympic athletes",
    "content": "A Russian official has admitted for the first time the existence of a doping campaign that involved hundreds of the country’s athletes. “It was an institutional conspiracy,” Anna Antseliovich, the acting director of Russia’s national anti-doping agency Rusada, told the New York Times on Tuesday. The government’s top officials were not involved, however, Antseliovich said.\n\nRusada said on Wednesday that Antseliovich’s comments had been distorted and taken out of context. A statement given to the Tass news agency said the impression had wrongly been given that its leadership recognised there had been an “institutional conspiracy”. The Kremlin said it would check the veracity of the NYT report to make sure Antseliovich had been accurately quoted. “We are not inclined to consider this information as first hand,” said its spokesman Dmitry Peskov. “The accuracy of these words first needs to be checked.” The report details how the director of one laboratory tampered with urine samples at the Olympics and provided performance-enhancing drugs to athletes. The operation was assisted by the Federal Security Service and a deputy sports minister. Russia has long denied such an operation existed. But a report commissioned by the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) asserted this month that more than 1,000 Russians athletes across more than 30 sports – were involved in or benefited from state-sponsored doping between 2011 and 2015. The report, authored by a Canadian law professor, Richard McLaren, said the London 2012 Olympics were “corrupted on an unprecedented scale” due to Russian doping. After the McLaren report’s publication, the International Olympic Committee said it had opened disciplinary proceedings against 28 Russian athletes who competed at the 2014 Games in Sochi. An IOC statement read: “At this point in time, these 28 new cases are not AAFs [adverse analytical findings], like a positive doping test. However, the manipulation of the samples themselves could lead to an anti-doping rule violation and sanctions.”"

    "title": "Hillary Clinton conspiracy theories are a generation in the making | Jill Abramson",
    "content": "Since Trump won the election, the focus on his fringe connections has largely receded. Coverage of the new administration has quickly normalized. Washington reporters seem relieved to be covering a familiar ritual, the competition for top jobs in the Trump administration. Stories on Trump’s many conflicts of interest and abandoned promises have appeared, but none seem to resonate with the public. Thankfully, some events shake us out of our complacency. At Harvard last week, a bitter fight broke out between senior Trump and Clinton aides who appeared at a conference, held after every presidential election. The hundred or so student protesters standing outside with signs denouncing Donald Trump and his consigliere, Steve Bannon, indicated a different tone for this year’s confab. What set off the fireworks were comments praising Bannon, who did not attend, from David Bossie, Trump’s deputy campaign manager. Bossie’s encomium pushed Jennifer Palmieri, Hillary Clinton’s communications director, over the edge. She responded: “If providing a platform for white supremacists makes me a brilliant tactician, I am glad to have lost.” Palmieri is not wrong. Breitbart News, a rabidly right-wing news site, was described by Bannon as providing a platform for the “alt-right”, a far-right movement in the US. Some of the movement’s leaders, like Richard Spencer, have publicly used Nazi slogans and are openly white nationalists. It is important not to forget that. Because the news media has been shamed for having all but inaugurated Hillary Clinton, there has now been an avalanche of coverage about how Trump pulled off his surprise victory and the weaknesses of her campaign. This means that another important question has been under-covered: who killed Hillary Clinton? Kellyanne Conway’s answer at Harvard was simple: Hillary Clinton, with her lack of an economic message for the white working class and her inability to connect with people, killed herself. This is simply false. As in any good Agatha Christie mystery, there are so many suspects that it’s hard to find the real killer. But here are some obvious possibilities: The man who did not find Hillary crooked, FBI Director James Comey, is a chief suspect. First, though it is unusual and arguably unprofessional, Comey decided not to prosecute Clinton but publicly denounced her as reckless and careless in the treatment of the emails on her private server. In cases where no charges are pressed, the usual protocol is simply to announce that an investigation is closed. Then, 11 days before the election, he wrote a letter to Congress saying new emails found on her aide’s computer merited more review, completely stalling the momentum that seemed to be carrying Clinton to victory. Those who seek to minimize the Comey effect should keep in mind that exit polls show that one quarter of the electorate made up their minds in the last month before the election and went for Trump by eight points, much larger than his less-than-50% victory margin of the popular vote. The email “scandal” was overblown and disproportionately covered by the news media, magnifying the damage Comey did. The news networks dedicated more airtime to the emails than to all policy issues combined. Indeed, Comey seemed to use the media’s obsession to intervene for his apparently preferred candidate, Trump. Let’s return to David Bossie, the man who sparked the Harvard “cat-fight.” After Bill Clinton won the presidency, Bossie became one of the biggest floggers of the pseudo scandals that enveloped Bill and Hillary while they were in the White House. In 2008, his anti-Hillary “documentary” sparked the Citizens United case in the US supreme court that gutted the country’s campaign finance laws. Before joining the Trump campaign as Bannon’s deputy, Bossie was head of Citizens United. Ruth Marcus of The Washington Post, who has covered Bossie for as long as I have, calls him “The Captain Ahab of Clinton-haters.” At long last, he killed the whale. Bossie, of course, couldn’t kill alone. He had a band of co-conspirators from an anti-Clinton machine that has been fortified by hundreds of millions of dollars of dark money over the past generation. As First Lady, Clinton was ridiculed and vilified for calling this “a vast right-wing conspiracy,” but she was right. The activists, groups, think tanks and nonprofit “charities” that made hay over the petty controversies that dogged her had already succeeded in driving up her negative trust and honesty numbers well before the 2016 campaign. The garden was already planted; all Donald Trump needed to do is water it with his chants of “Crooked Hillary.” Clinton actually received the third highest vote total in US election history (only Barack Obama won more the two times he was elected), and she won the popular vote by 2.5 million, a big margin. Still she lost in the electoral college, but if 100,000 votes had gone the other way in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania, she would have won there, too. It is too easy to write off Clinton supporters who oppose Trump, like Jennifer Palmieri, as sore losers. We all have a right – and a duty – to call out misinformation and divisive tactics from Trump and his enablers at places like Breitbart. Much is at stake if Trump and his brand of politics is normalized. It’s up to all of us to prevent that from happening."

    "title": "UK Muslims show worrying belief in conspiracy theories, claims thinktank",
    "content": "Britain’s Muslim communities have “separatist” tendencies and a “deeply worrying” belief in conspiracy theories, according to one of the government’s favourite centre-right thinktanks. The controversial Policy Exchange report however does acknowledge that 93% of British Muslims have a strong attachment to Britain and their attitudes to many issues such as the NHS, unemployment and immigration are broadly in line with the rest of the population. The report published on Friday comes out before the findings of a government-commissioned review, chaired by Dame Louise Casey, into integration and community cohesion in Britain are due to be published early next week. The Muslim Council of Britain (MCB) strongly criticised the thinktank’s report, saying it seemed to pursue an agenda to cast British Muslims as separate, dangerous and in need of saving, while the thinktank had “provided ample fodder to countless headlines demonising Muslims”. The findings of the Policy Exchange report, Unsettled Belonging, are based upon an ICM poll which is described as the most comprehensive to date of British Muslim opinion based on interviews with 3,000 people. Its findings say that Britain’s Muslims “live on average somewhat more separately than other significant minorities” but 53% show an appetite to integrate more with non-Muslims in all aspects of life. However it also found that 31% believed the US government was behind the 9/11 terror attacks with a further 7% blaming the Jews and only 4% saying al-Qaida was responsible. The thinktank also highlighted findings that British Muslims were more likely to condemn acts of political violence and terrorism than the rest of the population but that one in four British Muslims claimed that “extremist views do not exist”. When asked what they would do if they became aware someone close to them was “getting involved with people who support terrorism in Syria” only 52% said they would report them to the police. A foreword to the pamphlet by the Labour MP for Birmingham Perry Barr, Khalid Mahmood, said it was startling that so many British Muslims seemed ready to entertain wild and outlandish conspiracy theories about “dark forces” at work to “do down Muslims”. He said that the poll found that organisations such as the MCB had very little support among British Muslims and were failing to reflect their views on issues such as Prevent. He suggested that the government needed to realise their views only represented “the sectional demands of those on the fringes of British Muslim life”. David Goodhart, co-author of the report and head of the thinktank’s integration and immigration unit, said: “British Muslims as a whole continue to live somewhat more separately than other large ethno-cultural minorities – in neighbourhoods and schools, in terms of women not working, and in terms of attitudes and religiosity. “However, the promising news from this survey is that when it comes to everyday life, British Muslims, and their concerns and interests, are increasingly part of the mainstream, and to a much greater extent than one would assume listening to many of the organisations that claim to speak for Muslims.” The MCB responded by saying Policy Exchange had misused otherwise promising ICM poll results in its “decade-long” attempt to “delegitimise” its organisation. “There are some disturbing results in the poll that deserve further investigation. A large minority of Muslims seem to agree that conspiracy theories ‘often contain elements of truth’, in line with the broader UK population (40% v 37%). In addition, more British Muslims have conspiracy views about 9/11 in a proportion that is high and similar to results polling the US population on this issue,” said an MCB statement. “As the Muslim Council of Britain, we will be meeting to discuss how to understand this problem properly so that action can be taken to challenge these worrying views.”"

    "title": "'Pizzagate conspiracy' gunman: 'I regret how I handled the situation'",
    "content": "The gunman who fired an assault rifle inside the Washington DC restaurant at the heart of false allegations of a VIP child-sex ring has said he now regrets his actions. “I just wanted to do some good and went about it the wrong way,” Edgar Welch, 28, told a reporter from the New York Times, adding: “I regret how I handled the situation.” Welch was arrested on Sunday at the Comet Ping Pong pizzeria, which became the subject of lurid conspiracy theories after it was mentioned in the personal emails of John Podesta, Hillary Clinton’s campaign chief, published by WikiLeaks. The controversy, which has been labelled Pizzagate, centres on references in the emails to Comet Ping Pong and to various types of food and other objects that online researchers have claimed are codewords for child sexual abuse. Further investigations have thrown up a number of circumstantial links that self-appointed online detectives say indicate the existence of a network of powerful paedophiles. Accusations have been levelled against a number of senior Democrats, including Hillary Clinton and her husband Bill, the former president. Those involved in the controversy deny all allegations of wrongdoing, and the speculation – which has taken place to a large extent on Twitter, YouTube and online forums such as Reddit – has widely been dismissed as another example of the so-called “fake news” phenomenon.\n\nMeanwhile, a New York restaurant has become the latest target of conspiracy theorists. Roberta’s, a Brooklyn restaurant known for its wood-fired pizza, received telephone calls threatening its employees, police confirmed on Wednesday. There have been no arrests. It was after reading online reports of the Pizzagate controversy that Welch, a father of two from Salisbury, North Carolina, woke up on Sunday, told his family he had some things to do, and got in his car for the 350-mile drive to Washington DC, the New York Times reported. According to the paper’s interview Welch said he had wanted to give Comet Ping Pong a “closer look” to “shed some light” on the rumours before returning home. Welch found no children held captive at the restaurant when he stormed in with his AR-15 rifle. However, although he admitted that “the intel on this wasn’t 100%”, Welch refused to disavow the claims he had read online. He also said he did not like the term “fake news”, which he saw as a pejorative term that attempted to denigrate reports carried by alternative media."

    "title": "Inside the hate-filled echo chamber of racism and conspiracy theories",
    "content": "In the wake of Donald Trump’s presidential victory, it was said that Twitter had helped swing the election for the property developer, reality TV star and insatiable tweeter. But some of his more high-profile supporters on the so-called “alt-right” who have had their Twitter accounts suspended are abandoning the platform in favour of a new social network called Gab. The self-styled cult iconoclast Milo Yiannopoulos of Breitbart has apparently joined the likes of Trump attack-dog Ann Coulter and the excitable Alex Jones of Infowars in signing up with Gab. There is even a parody RealPresidentTrump account that for a short while presented itself – all too convincingly – as the real thing. And recently the white nationalist leader Richard B Spencer went so far as to claim that Twitter had sent “execution squads across the alt-right” to purge users with far-right views. He predicted that Gab would be “the place where we go next”. The brainchild of its 25-year-old Christian conservative founder, Andrew Torba, Gab promises to guarantee free speech, no matter how offensive. It is currently in the early “beta” stage of development and there is an extensive waiting list to join. When I applied, wanting to take a look at the site, I was told there were more than 400,000 applicants in front of me, and was advised that it could take a week before I was allowed on. Instead I used the login of a colleague in America and spent 48 hours in a strange world of Trump worship, white nationalism, racism, conspiracy theory, gun idolatry and crass humour, all of it delivered with the righteous conviction of total certainty. The effect is a little like viewing the world through a circus mirror while being constantly told that this is what reality looks like. The site is divided into 11 sections, including news, politics, technology, sport, art and philosophy, although the distinctions can often look arbitrary because a similar, slightly rabid rhetoric informs many of the postings, regardless of heading. Like a lot of social media it feels a bit empty, reminding you of that old Gertrude Stein quote about her hometown of Oakland: there is no there there. The way it works is that “Gabbers” can vote a post up or down, so that the most popular posting is at the top of the page. At the top of the politics page when I first checked in was a contribution from a poster named “Lord Humungus”. It featured a photograph of Michelle Obama and another of Melania Trump, along with the observation: “I’m proud to soon have a #FirstLady who’s actually pretty and more human than ape.” That was the extent of the wisdom that had earned top spot in the politics listing. A little way down, Our Talking Points linked to a YouTube video that claimed that the Sandy Hook school massacre, in which 20 children and six teachers were shot dead, was a hoax with the hashtag Newsisfaked! The belief that the shooting was staged, that the grieving parents are professional actors and that President Obama only pretended to cry while speaking about the tragedy are themes that break out across the site like acne. Distrust of the mainstream media (MSM) is widespread on Gab, with posters often citing blogs, obscure news sites or Russian media for supporting evidence. The attitude is summed up by an image posted on the site of a tombstone with the engraving “2016 RIP Mainstream Media: lied, cheated and overplayed their hand”. A notable outcome of the new anti-liberal political order that’s taking shape is that both the far right and far left are inclined to venerate the autocratic figure of Vladimir Putin, and in particular his murderous intervention in Syria.\n\nSeveral posters brought admiring attention to an interview with Syria’s president Bashar al-Assad on the Russian-state funded Russia Today, in which Assad claimed President Obama was behind the creation of Islamic State. Not all Gab posters are paranoid conspiracy theorists, Putin-lovers and gun fanatics. There are some innocuous or mildly sceptical posters, and even one or two Democrats. Moreover, Torba insists that the site is open to everyone of whatever political persuasion. However, it’s clear that the overwhelming tone is of a politics that starts with Trump and moves swiftly and hysterically rightwards from there."

    "title": "McLaren report: more than 1,000 Russian athletes involved in doping conspiracy",
    "content": "That’s all from the press conference in London. Here are the main points from part two of the McLaren report into doping in sport: • More than 1,000 Russian athletes across 30 sports were involved in or benefitted from “an institutional conspiracy” of doping. The cover-up, which dates back to at least 2011, evolved into a sophisticated doping programme on “an unprecedented scale” • Among a variety of techniques which went to staggering lengths, Russian officials added salt and Nescafé coffee granules to urine samples to make them match dirty samples and trick testers • Vitaly Mutko, then-Russian minister for sport and now the deputy prime minister, is implicated via his department’s involvement, but there is no “direct evidence” that he knew of the doping programme. Vladimir Putin is not mentioned in the report • The corruption at London 2012 will probably never be fully established but many Russian athletes who competed in the Games were part of the doping programme • Prof Richard McLaren appeals for major organisations in sport and anti-doping to collaborate and “end the in-fighting” And you can read Sean Ingle’s story here:\n\nThe IAAF agrees with Prof. McLaren that it is time that this manipulation stops and with this aim has been working in close cooperation with Prof. McLaren’s team and WADA and continues to do so. Based on the individual athletes that Prof. McLaren’s team have shared with us, over half (53%) of the elite athletes have already been sanctioned or are currently undergoing disciplinary proceedings. We will follow up on the rest as soon as the evidence from the IP’s investigation is made available to us via WADA. The IAAF has a history of comprehensive testing and a strong retesting strategy with samples stored back to 2007. This has allowed us, using information shared by the McLaren team, to pursue an even more specific, intelligence-based retesting programme. Russian samples from IAAF World Championships up to and including Moscow 2013 have been, or are in the process of being, reanalysed. At this stage three further samples from Osaka 2007 have been reported as Adverse Analytical Findings and results from Daegu 2011 are due next week. In total in 2016, 35 Russian athletes have been sanctioned or charged with an ADRV by the IAAF (not counting the meldonium cases). IAAF President Sebastian Coe commented: “The IAAF has been at the forefront of anti-doping since 1928 when we were the first international federation to prohibit doping in sport. We will continue to test intelligently, retest smartly, work collaboratively and seek swift justice. The independent Athletics Integrity Unit launching in April 2017 will give us, and clean athletes the world over, the strongest platform possible to deliver this.”"

    "title": "Polish defence minister condemned over Jewish conspiracy theory",
    "content": "Poland’s newly appointed defence minister has been condemned for entertaining the possibility that a fraudulent document claiming to show there is a Jewish plan for world domination may be real. Antoni Macierewicz is one of a number of controversial appointments the rightwing Law and Justice party made on Monday after securing an absolute majority for the first time in the country’s general election. His appointment could complicate Poland’s relations with Nato and EU allies as they seek to contain Russia. It could also prove difficult for David Cameron, whose European Conservatives and Reformists group is propped up by Law and Justice.\n\nMacierewicz told listeners to Radio Maryja in 2002 that he had read Protocols of the Elders of Zion, a pamphlet that purports to be a Jewish plan to control the global economy and media, but which has been exposed as a hoax. He acknowledged there was debate about the pamphlet’s authenticity, but told a listener: “Experience shows that there are such groups in Jewish circles.” His words have been widely condemned by anti-racist campaigners in Poland. Rafał Pankowski, who wrote about Macierewicz’s appearance on the radio show in a book about Poland’s far right, said: “He is well known for his divisive, radical style of politics, which is rooted in the nationalist identity discourse of Radio Maryja. “The political culture of Law and Justice seems strongly influenced by such discourse. It is a sad time for Polish and European democracy if the promotion of conspiracy theories is rewarded with high-level appointments.” A former member of Poland’s anti-communist opposition movement and deputy defence minister, Macierewicz is known for his efforts to purge the country’s military intelligence services of communist and Russian influence. In the early 1990s, he led a search for communists among former Solidarity leaders, accusing them of having worked for the secret police. He even accused the union’s founder, Lech Wałęsa, of being a spy known as Agent Bolek, but his claims could not be proven. More recently, he has been the main champion of a theory that a plane crash that killed 96 Poles in 2010, including the Polish president, was assassination orchestrated by Russia, rather than an accident as official investigations found. “The government headed by [Russia’s then prime minister Vladimir] Putin is fully responsible for this tragedy,” he told the European parliament in March. “It may be said that it was the first salvo in a war which today is going on in the east of Europe, and which is ever more dramatically nearing EU and Nato borders.” The Russian government blamed pilot error, and Polish investigators have said airport crew were also responsible. Macierewicz’s incendiary language may concern diplomats in Brussels already wary about the victory of the nationalist and Eurosceptic Law and Justice. Protocols of the Elders of Zion was supposed to have been first published in Russia in the 1900s, translated into various languages and disseminated internationally in the early 20th century. It claimed to be the minutes of a late 19th-century meeting of Jewish leaders, in which they discussed their goal of a global plan to subvert the morals of gentiles and control the press and the global economy. Journalists and historians exposed it as a fraud in the 1920s, showing it to contain chunks of text lifted from other books. It was nonetheless studied in German classrooms after the Nazis came to power in 1933. Law and Justice became the first party in post-communist Poland to win an absolute majority in parliament, giving it unprecedented control over policy. Its return to power brings back the former prime minister Jarosław Kaczyński, whose government annoyed European allies with anti-EU rhetoric between 2005 and 2007. Law and Justice did not respond to the Guardian’s request for a comment."

    "title": "Paris attacks: latest evidence points to wider conspiracy",
    "content": "New evidence emerging from the investigation into the Paris attacks points to a conspiracy significantly wider than the nine jihadi thought to have carried out the killings and that was orchestrated primarily by disaffected young Europeans. Seven men and a woman were detained in the aftermath of Wednesday morning’s shootout in the Paris suburb of St-Denis, including the tenant of the apartment that was the focus of the police raid, Jawad Bendaoud, who told journalists he had been asked by a friend to put up “two of his mates for a few days”. He said all he knew is “they came from Belgium”. The St-Denis detentions bring the number of people being held in connection with Friday night’s assault on Paris to 10. Two Belgians, Mohammed Amri and Hamza Attou, have been charged in Brussels with complicity in the attacks and participation in terrorist activity. They have admitted driving to Paris to pick up one of the attackers, a friend from the Molenbeek neighbourhood of Brussels, and escorting him back home.\n\nThat attacker, Salah Abdeslam, is still at large, but French police distributed to their European counterparts the details and number plate of a Citroen Xsara they believe he may be driving. Dutch police also revealed he had been arrested in the Netherlands in February for possession of cannabis."

    "title": "Donald Trump: attacking free speech only feeds the conspiracy junkies | Nick Cohen",
    "content": "The hundreds of thousands demanding that Britain ban Donald Trump should ask themselves if they would be happy about America banning Jeremy Corbyn. The answer you give will show whether you understand how to fight the illiberal ideologies that are flourishing across the western world. It’s easy enough to make the case for keeping Trump out. Whether you should call him a “fascist” is open to debate. But the fact that you can debate it shows you are dealing with an incontinent demagogue. His sectarian proposal to stop Muslims coming to America is one of the most un-American assaults on the constitution’s protection of freedom of religion in modern times. The casting of Mexicans as rapists and murderers is the most extreme racial profiling I have seen in years. Trump has the swagger of Mussolini and the sexism of a pimp. Leaving all other considerations aside, any man who can say of his daughter, “If I weren’t happily married, and ya know, her father…” should be stopped at the borders by social workers. Equally, the doziest homeland security officer could make a case for refusing Corbyn entry to the US. He was a shamelessly useful idiot for the state propaganda channels of Russia and Iran. He repeated Kremlin justifications for the Russian invasion of Ukraine. If Trump is an out and loud anti-Muslim bigot, Corbyn is a quieter but no less insistent defender of antisemites. A US government that once banned Nigella Lawson, who has brought nothing but happiness to humanity, for snorting cocaine, should find banning Corbyn easy. Easy, but hopeless. Attacks on freedom of speech are not effective attacks on your opponents. In principle, they are repugnant. In practice, they are disastrous. Conspiratorial thinking isn’t a part of the far right or far left. It is essential to both. Their leaders need to persuade their supporters that dark forces are scheming against them. They need to believe it themselves. Only a conspiracy can explain the failure of others to agree with them; the death of their hopes and waste of their lives. George W Bush’s former speechwriter, David Frum, encapsulated how conservative America was barricading itself in a stockade when he said: “Republicans originally thought that Fox worked for us and now we’re discovering we work for Fox.” It’s not that Fox and the shock-jock stations have huge audiences. But they are listened to by the minority who vote for Trump in Republican primaries. Fox makes $1bn a year by painting every moderate republican as a sellout and every liberal opponent as a monster. There’s no evidence that it makes undecided voters turn into headbanging conservatives. On the contrary, it helps the Republicans lose by creating the atmosphere in which a bloated billionaire with a flabby tongue and rancid mind can pose as the defender of the “little guy”. Even when other Republican candidates are trying to cling on to what remains of their party’s honour by criticising Trump, all Howard Kurtz of Fox News could manage was a sly whine about liberal journalists making “partisan” criticisms – as if political argument could ever or should ever be anything other than partisan. Stay in the tribe, he said in effect. Condemn Trump and you place yourself on the same side as the hated liberal elite. Anyone who has tried to repeat the established facts about Corbyn will have seen the tactic deployed with depressing success here. First you’re told it’s a lie. Then you’re told it doesn’t matter. Then you’re told you’re a Tory. Banning only heightens the conspiratorial delusion. The liberal elite, the new world order, the establishment, –THEM – want to silence truth and punish the bearers of bad news. Since the 1960s, liberal societies have replaced old laws censoring sex and violence with new laws censoring racism, sexism and homophobia. You cannot say that they have slowed the growth of far-right parties and movements across the developed world. On the contrary, censorship has made reactionary politics seem like honest dissent. France has more laws restricting free speech than any other western democracy. It also has Europe’s largest far-right party, which revels in its status as a victim of a coercive technocratic elite. At the root of this self-inflicted liberal defeat is an inability to understand how argument works. You believe, with justice, that nothing you say will convince Trump or Marine le Pen that they are wrong. They are your enemy: unteachable and irreconcilable. You do not treat them as decent opponents, but use every power available at your disposal to defeat them. Go too far down that hard road, however, and you lose sight of their lukewarm supporters and potential converts. They are spectators at the contest. They are waiting to see how the argument goes before making up their minds. The explosion of nationalist populism suggests that screams of “no platform” and calls to send in the police have not impressed. To persuade them to break with leaders, you must go further than accept you don’t win debates by gagging them. You must address the real grievances of an extremist’s supporters, or at least find it in yourself to admit that not all their grievances are unreasonable. It is easy enough to denounce Trump; harder to admit that liberals on both sides of the Atlantic have treated criticism of Islamists as criticism of all Muslims and accused those fighting the most illiberal movements on Earth of racism. By all means condemn Corbyn’s association with radical Islam and Russian imperialism, but if you forget to add when you bring up his closeness to antisemites that the Palestinians have a non-negotiable right to a state of their own, you will not deserve a hearing. European politicians have every reason to warn against the far right, but will deserve to fail if they do not accept that it is driven by the misery that the single currency has brought and legitimate questions about how many immigrants European societies can take. And everywhere, whether in Europe or America, established politicians have yet to say how long their electorates should cope with falling incomes for the working and middle classes, or how they will offer hope of a future where children have better lives than their parents. Condemning extremists is as easy a signing an online petition. Detaching wavering supporters from the hardcore is a long struggle. You cannot expect to enter the fight and emerge with every one of your old convictions intact. • Comments will be opened in the morning"

    "title": "The conspiracy theories of extreme right and far left threaten democracy | Natalie Nougayréde",
    "content": "Type in “conspiracy theories” and it is amazing what magma bubbles up. There are entire websites devoted to laying out the wildest scenarios supposedly hidden behind events from the assassinations of JFK and John Lennon to the deaths of Marilyn Monroe and Princess Diana, to 9/11; even the recent Paris attacks are the subject of online ramblings. Shocks occur, and crazy theories start swirling. Psychologists have tried to explain the phenomenon. Some things can be so painful or traumatic that factual, documented truths are discarded and minds are sucked into half-baked conspiratorial versions. This is the things-aren’t-what-they-seem school of thought. Nothing new perhaps. But what has become most striking is the degree to which conspiracy theories now abound in the political arena. This is one of the most striking features of the rise of the new populist or insurgent parties across Europe and beyond. The role of conspiracy theories is worth dwelling on because it points to some of the difficulties of representative, liberal democracies today. It’s useful to compare the mechanisms and put them in historical context. It is no coincidence that conspiracy theories are often used by authoritarian systems to crush dissent.\n\nIt was telling that in France, Marine Le Pen decided to cry foul after her far-right Front National party failed to win executive power in a single region in elections this month. The way she saw it the elites – lumped together in a single bloc identified as “the regime” – had conspired to block her rise. According to her vision, enemies of the FN join forces in obscure ways, hindering the will of “the people”, which Le Pen’s party claims to represent single-handedly. Never mind that what actually happened was the simple exercise of French electoral law and tactical voting – Le Pen needed to frame events in terms of victimhood. This “us versus them” talk is not confined to the French far-right. It is a thread that runs through just about all populist, demagogic movements. In Putin’s Russia, the official rhetoric centres on the notion that western powers are intent on blocking “legitimate” Russian national ambitions abroad and dismantling the very statehood of Russia by manipulating groups from within. Similar logic has come to the fore in the Venezuela of Hugo Chávez and his successor, Nicolás Maduro – regimes prone to ascribe every domestic setback to plots fostered by the US. If “Bolivarian” revolutions stumble, as recently happened in elections, this can only have outside causes, ones that are camouflaged, the results of secret plots. Conspiracy theories were a big feature of Soviet bloc regimes, as authors like Czeslaw Milosz and Václav Havel described. But it’s also important not to overlook that they still exist to a degree in parts of Europe’s far-left. The “anti-elite” message of the most radical elements of Podemos in Spain and of Greece’s Syriza movement may have attractive elements – understandable in the context of economic austerity, high unemployment and deep frustration among many young people. But less emphasised is the way these movements systematically cast themselves as the victims of vague and wide-ranging forces set on undermining their political prospects. Their language is, of course, entirely different from Le Pen’s on immigration and refugees – but there’s some convergence. She speaks of “the regime” as an enemy – not unlike Podemos, which describes Spain’s 1978 constitutional system as la casta: an entity that must be overturned in its entirety because it supposedly impedes the genuine expression of the will of the people. If Podemos and Syriza stumble, failing to meet electoral ambitions or promises, they are tempted to blame forces external to them: the European Union, globalised capitalism or obscure lobbies. What counts is that the traditional rules of the political game are questioned and the legitimacy of representative democracy is put into doubt."

    "title": "Former CEO found guilty of conspiracy in West Virginia mine explosion",
    "content": "Don Blankenship, the “outlaw” former coal executive and enemy of environmentalists, has been found guilty of a conspiracy over events that led to a deadly mine explosion in West Virginia. Nine days of jury deliberation, which was put on hold over the Thanksgiving, have resulted in Blankenship being found guilty of a conspiracy to commit safety violations at the mine. But he has been acquitted of charges that he made false statements and committed securities fraud. An explosion at the Upper Big Branch mine in April 2010 killed 29 miners. A jury deliberated over the fate of Blankenship for six weeks, hearing testimony from 27 witnesses and sifting through more than 500 pieces of evidence. Blankenship, 65, is the former chief executive of Massey Energy, a coal company that was acquired by Alpha Natural Resources in 2011.\n\nHe was charged with three criminal counts over his role in dodging federal mine safety laws at the Upper Big Branch mine in Raleigh County. He was also accused of committing fraud through a statement sent to shareholders following the mine explosion. He denied all of the charges from the outset. Federal regulators said a series of unsafe practices led to the explosion, with US attorney Booth Goodwin telling court that “Don Blankenship ran a massive criminal conspiracy”. Goodwin said an internal memo shows that Blankenship was aware of measures to make the mines safe but chose to not do so. Blankenship, according to Goodwin, was an “outlaw” who pushed miners to continue extracting coal in hazardous conditions. Bill Taylor, Blankenship’s defence attorney, said the federal government had provided “no witnesses, no proof” to back up its charges. Taylor had moved for a mistrial, arguing that the long distance travel required of jurors and the looming Thanksgiving holiday increased the likelihood of a rushed decision. Judge Irene Berger rejected the request. Democratic senator for West Virginia Joe Manchin said he was pleased with the verdict. “With this verdict, the state of West Virginia has set precedents and signaled that we will not allow the prioritization of production and profits over the safety of our workers,” he said. “While nothing can ever bring back the 29 beloved souls who we lost on that tragic day, I hope that today brings some closure and peace to the families of the miners.” The makers of Blood on the Mountain, a new documentary about environmental and economic injustice in West Virginia, also welcomed the outcome. “This verdict has finally held a coal company executive criminally responsible for his crimes against his own workers for his own greed,” said Mari-Lynn Evans, the film’s director and producer. “This guilty verdict affirms our faith in justice, and it will have a tremendous a tremendous and lasting impact on how the coal industry does business. For West Virginians, this verdict affirms that the lives of our coal miners is more important than the cost of a mule.”"

    "title": "Real Enemies: bringing conspiracy theories and paranoia to the stage",
    "content": "If you’ve ever toyed with the idea that the CIA might have killed JFK, that Nasa might have faked the moon landings, or that shape-shifting reptilian Illuminati might rule the world – or if you’ve simply ever wondered how anyone else could entertain such ideas – Real Enemies, the multimedia production at the Brooklyn Academy of Music’s New Wave festival, may stoke your conspiratorial embers. Writer-director Isaac Butler, composer Darcy James Argue and theatrical designer Peter Nigrini have crafted a show that uses music, video and set design to explore the world of conspiracy theories. (The title is drawn from Kathryn Olmsted’s comprehensive history of paranoia in American politics, ranging from the first world war up to 9/11.) The program, which is divided into 12 chapters, involves very little spoken text. Instead setting, mood and thematic content are conveyed almost entirely through music and visual imagery. When treating the theory that the CIA helped introduce crack cocaine to South Central Los Angeles in the 1980s in order to fund Nicaraguan contras – a notion popularized by the late journalist Gary Webb – Argue establishes a sense of time and place by nodding to LA electrofunk-influenced hip-hop, while footage of Nancy Reagan giving her 1986 “Just Say No” speech lends a dash of video-driven irony to the proceedings. Real Enemies is not only about particular conspiracy theories, however. It is also about conspiracy thinking as process; about how – and why – people of all races, classes and creeds invent these (sometimes plausible, often outlandish) narratives.\n\nAs such, Darcy says, the show grapples with our fundamental urge to make sense of the world through storytelling, and with the very nature of belief itself; with our genius for finding meaning and order in the universe, and with the comfort that such meaning and order provide. “It’s really telling that for so many people, it’s more terrifying to contemplate a world full of randomness and chaos than of governmental incompetence and long-standing ineptitude,” he says. Real Enemies doesn’t just want audiences to understand conspiracy thinking, however. It wants them to engage in it. And it does so by exploiting the same narrative instinct that allows us to connect the dots between seemingly disparate events. This might mean using music that alludes to the unnerving scores of conspiracy thrillers such as The Parallax View, while simultaneously splashing different images on to each of the 15 projection screens arrayed on stage. “Sometimes,” admits Nigrini, “we intentionally present more information than the audience can digest.” That information overload mixes with elements of conspiracy thinking which pervade every aspect of the production. Nigrini drew visual inspiration from movies like The Parallax View and The Manchurian Candidate, which used filmmaking techniques to engender a sense of paranoia among viewers. (“If the picture works,” Parallax director Alan J Pakula allegedly told his star, Warren Beatty, “the audience will trust the person next to them a little less.”) He also looked to the work of Stanley Kubrick, a man who was the subject of more than a few conspiracy theories himself."

    "title": "UK ties with Gaddafi were like 'a criminal conspiracy', high court hears",
    "content": "The relationship that the British security services forged with Muammar Gaddafi’s regime a decade ago amounted to “a criminal conspiracy with a foreign dictator”, according to evidence before the high court, where a dozen Libyan dissidents who were subsequently targeted by the British authorities are bringing a claim for damages. It was a conspiracy that resulted in the UK becoming “enmeshed in illegality” in Libya, where it became involved in rendition, unlawful detention and torture, Thomas de la Mare QC, representing the dissidents, told the court. Within the UK, MI5 “seemingly routinely used blackmail” to pressure Libyans into becoming unwilling informants for the intelligence agencies of both countries, by threatening their relatives in Libya with imprisonment and mistreatment if they failed to co-operate. Furthermore, De la Mare said, information that was extracted from prisoners in Tripoli was fed into the British court system, but always during secret evidence sessions – or closed material procedures – where it could not be fully challenged. Six Libyan men, the widow of a seventh and five British citizens of Libyan and Somali origin are bringing a number of claims based on allegations of false imprisonment, blackmail, misfeasance in public office and conspiracy to assault. The claims are being brought against MI5 and MI6, as well as the Home Office and Foreign Office. The case is one of a number arising out of the rapprochement between the UK and Libya, a process that began in late 2003. The evidence on which the latest claims are being made includes a number of previously secret documents recovered during the Libyan revolution of 2011, including a cache found at the offices of Gaddafi’s former intelligence chief, Musa Kusa. The claimants were variously subjected to control orders in the UK or detained pending deportation, following the thawing of UK-Libyan relations. Two had their assets frozen. The lead claimant, Ismail Kamoka, had lived in the UK for eight years before his arrest in November 2002, and spent the next 16 months in custody while fighting deportation.\n\nThe recovered documents showed the British government’s case against some of the men was based upon information supplied by two Libyan opposition leaders, Sami al-Saadi and Abdul Hakim Belhaj, who were detained and rendered to Tripoli in 2004, along with their families. The documents also showed MI6 to have been involved in the two renditions. An MI5 officer subsequently told the Special Immigration Appeals Commission, which hears immigration cases related to national security, that he did not know how Belhaj came to be in Tripoli or how he was being treated. “We now know that the UK provided the intelligence to facilitate the US rendition [of Belhaj] and we have inferred that the rendition occurred through the UK facility of Diego Garcia,” said De la Mare. Furthermore, MI5 officers who had previously questioned Belhaj in prison in Libya had been informed by him – “in no uncertain terms” – that he was being tortured by his Libyan captors. This brought into question the credibility of both MI5 witnesses and the source reports on which they relied, said de la Mare. “Whether they put up a witness who didn’t know the answer, or he was actively lying, we don’t know.” Because part of every SIAC hearing is held in secret, in the absence of appellants and their lawyers, the high court claimants cannot be sure what evidence the government introduced or held back. However, in written submissions, lawyers for the claimants said that judges at Siac “no doubt assumed (in the absence of any disclosure to the contrary) that it was not the practice of the security services to engage in criminal conspiracies with foreign dictators to facilitate the rendition, detention and torture of targeted individuals”. Seventeen months after Belhaj and Saadi were rendered with UK assistance, the British government signed a memorandum of understanding with the Gaddafi regime that was intended to facilitate deportations to Libya. It included Libyan assurances that it would not mistreat anyone deported from the UK to Libya, and these were accepted by the UK despite its intelligence officers having knowledge of the mistreatment of the two rendition victims, De la Mare said. The court heard that one of the recovered documents is a Libyan intelligence officer’s record of a meeting in London with MI5, who warned him that they should jointly take steps to “avoid being trapped in any sort of legal problem [and] to avoid also that those joint plans be discovered by lawyers or human rights organisations and the media”. Another was a letter that Tony Blair wrote to Gaddafi in April 2007, to thank him for the “excellent cooperation” between the two countries’ intelligence agencies."

    "content": "In her article on conspiracy theories, Natalie Nougayrède writes that, according to Marine Le Pen, enemies of the Front National “join forces in obscure ways” to hinder her party (The conspiracy theories of extreme right and far left threaten democracy, 19 December). Nothing in the least obscure about it. Despite having scratched one another’s eyes out at the first round of voting in the recent French elections, the mainstream left and right openly allied at the second round to prevent the FN winning in regions where it was most strongly placed. To accuse Ms Le Pen of seeking refuge in a conspiracy theory is yet another example of the refusal of French commentators and the political establishment to face the facts, which can only further fuel the FN’s ascent – as it has for the last two decades. Jonathan Fenby London • Natalie Nougayrède doesn’t seem to realise that linking “the rise of the new populist and insurgent parties” with conspiracy theories is itself a conspiracy theory. And there is nothing inherently anti-democratic about such theories. To deny conspiracy is to be very naive about how power works in the world. It is true there are some wacky theories around, but there are just as many that are open to and seek out empirical verification. Nougayrède refers to “the things-aren’t-what-they-seem school of thought”. I would argue that it is nearly always the case in politics that things aren’t what they seem, since protagonists of any view always attempt to “spin” it, and good journalists often define their role as “getting behind the headlines”. John Quicke Patrington, East Yorkshire • Unfortunately, Natalie Nougayrède did not mention some classic and very real conspiracies. The Iran-Contra affair was a classic conspiracy, as too was Watergate and Ted Heath’s government’s efforts to quash legitimate trade union action – no need for theorising there. The powerful say they have “plans” and “strategies”, and describe all those without political or financial power and who try to see around those schemes as “conspiracy theorists” – who uses which terms is part of power play. Robin Le Mare Allithwaite, Cumbria • Just as Natalie Nougayrède behoves us to abandon our conspiracy theories of “the system” and “the regime”, we find that you report, on the same day, that Messrs Murdoch and Osborne have been at it behind closed doors (Osborne met Murdoch twice in run-up to BBC licence fee deal, 19 December).

    "title": "Hillary Clinton dismisses 'conspiracy theory' amid email server controversy",
    "content": "Hillary Clinton has denied that she set up a private email server in an attempt to bypass public accountability for her actions as secretary of state with a future presidential run in mind, dismissing the idea as a “totally ridiculous … conspiracy theory”.\n\nWith her poll numbers continuing to plummet, Clinton subjected herself to a lengthy interview on NBC News’ Meet the Press on Sunday. She held tight to the by-now familiar formula in which she expresses a combination of contrition and combativeness regarding the long-running saga over her decision to set up a private email server while serving as America’s top diplomat. “Of course I take responsibility,” she said. “It was my choice, it was a mistake back when I did it, and I’m trying to do the best I can to answer all the questions.” At the same time, she dismissed the ongoing dispute as “another conspiracy theory”, alluding to her earlier battles over what she then called the “vast right-wing conspiracy” against the Clintons when her husband was in the White House. “In the 90s I was subjected to the same barrage and it seemed at the time to be endless,” she said, “but then when I ran for Senate people were more concerned about what you are going to do for us, and I trust the voters to make that decision this time around too.” Clinton’s increasingly intense efforts to clear the fog surrounding her over the email server furor are simply explained: her standing among voters continues to tumble. In the latest poll, from NBC News and the Wall Street Journal and released on Sunday, her lead over the Vermont independent senator Bernie Sanders was down to just seven points, assuming Vice-President Joe Biden were to throw his hat into the ring. Clinton was on 42%, Sanders on 35% and Biden on 17%. It is an indication of how far Clinton has fallen that in June she commanded a whopping 60-point lead over Sanders. It is against this backdrop of dramatic poll figures that Biden’s supporters continue to press him to leap into the race. “You’ve taken a hit in the polls,” Chuck Todd of Meet the Press said. “I have,” Clinton responded, candidly. Clinton said her woes over her email server had been a “drip, drip, drip” that was impacting her. “There’s only so much I can control,” she said. At several points in the interview she stressed her own lack of technical prowess as an explanation for what had happened. At one point she used that argument to try and explain a flippant remark she made last month that led her to be widely criticised for being sardonic over a serious matter. On that occasion, asked in Las Vegas whether she had wiped her email server before handing it to the FBI, Clinton replied: “What? Like with a cloth or something?” On Sunday, she offered an apology … of sorts: “I know I was a little bit sarcastic in one exchange with the press – I’m sorry guys! – but I’m not a technical expert.” The frustration of that lack of control over public perception is clearly getting to Clinton’s husband, as much as anybody around her presidential campaign. In an interview broadcast by CNN on Sunday he let rip, blaming much of the kerfuffle on the vicariousness of the news media. “I have never seen so much expended on so little,” he snapped."

    "title": "The truth is rushing out there: why conspiracy theories spread faster than ever",
    "content": "“I remember reading about Final Fantasy VII, a movie I was really looking forward to. My initial reaction was disappointment that it was two years away – because by then we’d be under military control.” It was 2004, and Matthew Elliott was in deep. An ordinary guy from San Antonio, Texas, he had first been drawn to conspiracy theories when he was 19, in the aftermath of 9/11. “It seemed unfathomable that we could be attacked,” he says today. In his quest to make sense of what had happened he came across the notorious “truther” movement, a current of opinion that lays blame for the atrocities at the door of the US government.\n\n“The way most conspiracy theories are laid out, one thing always leads to another, so from there I became convinced that a ruling group called the New World Order orchestrated everything. This would all lead to martial law and a complete removal of our freedoms,” he says. A decade later, Elliott, now 34, is a “recovering” conspiracy theorist, having turned his back on a worldview that always posits some covert, powerful force acting against the interests of ordinary people. The change came gradually, but he thinks very differently now. “You can’t even get many of the 50 states to agree on things. Good luck convincing Europeans and Asians to get on board.” Elliott’s reaction to the trauma of 9/11 was far from unusual. The attacks were so unprecedented, so devastating, that many of us struggled to make sense of them. Early reports were confused or contradictory: as a result some treated the official version of events with scepticism. A proportion of those in turn plumped for an explanation that would require fakery and coordination on a massive scale. This shouldn’t surprise us: it’s a pattern that is repeated after every global shock, and in the aftermath of the Paris attacks, it has reared its head again. Within a day of the terrorist attacks on the French capital, blogs had been published arguing that they were the work of the government – a so-called “false flag” operation. The claims rest on the idea that Isis is the deliberate creation of western governments. More recently, the lawyer for the family of Syed Farook, one of the San Bernardino shooters, fuelled conspiratorial speculation when he said: “There’s a lot of motivation at this time to emphasise or create incidents that will cause gun control or prejudice or hatred towards the Muslim community.”"

    "title": "Conspiracy allegations against Clive Palmer’s adviser detailed in court documents",
    "content": "Clive Palmer’s media adviser Andrew Crook was embroiled in a criminal conspiracy with a former detective whose arrest threatens to expose organised crime figures, Queensland police have alleged. The alleged conspiracy is detailed in court documents filed by police after Crook and private investigator Michael Featherstone were charged this month with intimidating a witness, attempting to pervert the course of justice and attempted fraud against the National Australia Bank. In 2012 the entrepreneur Tony Smith lost a civil case against the NAB after suing the bank for $68m. Police allege that Smith subsequently hired Featherstone, a former police officer, to find evidence to use against the NAB. It is alleged that Smith, Featherstone and Crook plotted to induce a banker who testified in the case to change his testimony. Crook is accused of luring the banker, whom Guardian Australia has chosen not to name, to Singapore in January 2013, where the banker believed he would meet Palmer to discuss a job as his “global finance manager with an exorbitant pay salary”. Crook then took the banker to a villa on the nearby Indonesian island of Batam, according to the documents, where he introduced him to a supposed Palmer executive, “Michael Wright” – who was actually Featherstone. Police allege Featherstone conducted a bogus job interview in which he tried to extract a confession by telling the banker “that ‘Clive’ wanted to know if he was the type of person who would take one for the team and had he lied to protect the bank [in the court case]”. When the banker insisted he had told the truth, Featherstone allegedly replied that he “couldn’t sell that to Clive because Clive wanted someone who could show they are loyal”. Police claim Featherstone has “links to organised crime on the Gold Coast and abroad”, including bikies known to be part of crime networks that were “extensive with vast resources and access to cash”. Featherstone’s arrest might have sparked concerns among a crime syndicate that was under investigation that it might be exposed, police allege. “As a result Featherstone may be provided an opportunity to flee, be concealed or be prevented in appearing in future court appearances for the protection of said crime networks,” the documents state. The plot targeting the banker required “a high degree of professional knowledge and commitment that is consistent with that of the police detective”, police said. The banker’s “interview” with Featherstone was followed by what police claim was the conspirators’ “plan B” to force a confession. They allege men in security uniforms came into the villa, strip-searched the banker and took his mobile phone, wallet and passport before Featherstone announced: “The big guy is here.” Police claim the banker thought this was Palmer – but instead Smith entered and physically threatened him, saying Australian police “could not touch him” in Indonesia. Smith said he “owned” Indonesian police and that he would be jailed unless Smith obtained a confession he could use to get money from NAB, the documents state. Police said the banker agreed “in fear” to confess in a video “interview” with Featherstone, after which he was “released”. Smith allegedly told Featherstone by email a week earlier: “I just want to be really prepared in case Plan A does not work as I will not be leaving (and neither will [the banker]) until we have what you consider is 100% enough to turn the court case around or have [him] and his assistant charged with perjury or both.” Featherstone allegedly told Smith by email after the incident that if the banker went to authorities Australian police would be powerless to act. “The AFP or Q-pol have no jurisdiction concerning any alleged act in Indonesia and do not have the legal authority to hold anyone with respect to any allegation in that jurisdiction,” he allegedly wrote. It is alleged that Featherstone briefed Crook on how to handle police if approached about the plot. Featherstone allegedly said Crook, as the banker’s “link to the chain of events”, would be the first to be approached by police. “I briefed crooka on what to do in the event that this occurred and he is cool,” Featherstone allegedly said. The court documents state that NAB refused to negotiate when Smith’s lawyers tried to seek a payout using the confession. Featherstone also tried unsuccessfully to use the confession to get other NAB staff to change their evidence, it is alleged. An assistant of the banker, who had also given evidence in the 2012 case, was earlier approached by a friend of Smith’s then working at NAB, who discussed a possible payment if the assistant changed his evidence, police claim. Featherstone later used a false name to call the assistant and try to intimidate him into changing his evidence by reciting all the man’s assets and “personal particulars including his family”, it is alleged. Police claim Smith then colluded with Featherstone and Crook to “bait” the banker with the bogus job opportunity with Palmer. There is no suggestion in the documents that Palmer knew anything about the alleged plot. Lawyers for Crook and Featherstone argued at their 19 December bail hearings in Brisbane that the documents should be suppressed in the interests of a fair trial. Magistrate Paul Kluck was unmoved but granted both men bail. Crook’s solicitor Andrew McGinnes said there was no evidence his client, who was not present during the banker’s discussion with Featherstone, knew anything about “what was to be discussed at the meeting or how it was to be conducted”. Featherstone’s barrister Alastair McDougall told the court police were “notorious” for presenting one-sided accounts in court documents knowing they would enter the public domain. Police did not include Featherstone’s response to an email from Smith to indicate whether he agreed to be involved in “plan B”, McDougall said. Featherstone’s solicitor Chris Hannay said his client would “vigorously contest” the charges. Smith remains in Indonesia, according to the police affidavit."

    "title": "Gunpowder, treason and plot: literary conspiracy theories for bonfire night",
    "content": "Remember, Remember the Fifth of November, the day Guy Fawkes was discovered in the cellar of the House of Lords with 36 barrels of gunpowder, in one of history’s great conspiracies. The precise details of the gunpowder plot have been contested over the centuries. Was Fawkes part of a group of Catholic militants planning on blowing up the Parliament at its 1605 state opening, as the best-known story goes. Or was the whole plot organised by the Earl of Salisbury as a way of pressuring King James I to toughen up his anti-Catholic laws, as recent conspiracy theorists have suggested? Either way, we’ve decided to celebrate bonfire night with eight of the best literary conspiracy theories. 1) Charlotte Brontë killed her sisters According to criminologist James Tully, the author of Jane Eyre was not the secluded, intellectual spinster we imagine, but a violently envious and lustful murderess. All was peaceful in the Brontë household, Tully says, until the 1845 appearance of a (debatably) handsome and wily curate named Reverend Arthur Bell Nicholls. Tully claims that Nicholls encouraged Charlotte’s already envious disposition, and together they poisoned each one of her siblings. Emily and Branwell (who another theory says wrote Emily’s Wuthering Heights) died in 1848 at ages 30 and 31 respectively. Anne died in 1849 at 29. The common conception is that they all contracted tuberculosis or cholera, but Tully, who is also an expert in 19th-century poison, is convinced that they were murdered. A few years later Charlotte’s father “angrily chased” Nicholls from their estate. Soon after that, Charlotte eloped with Nicholls, only to die a year later. Tully claims that it was Nicholls’s plan all along to inherit the Brontë estate, and thus Charlotte met the same bleak fate as her siblings. Tully originally wrote his theory as non-fiction, but was unable to find a publisher; so he retold the story as fiction from the point of view of real-life maid Martha Brown. His book, The Crimes of Charlotte Brontë, gained some recognition, but was generally rejected by Brontë enthusiasts.\n\n2) JK Rowling didn’t write Harry Potter No one that pretty could actually have been that poor and that good at writing, right? No, Rowling is obviously an actress hired by a panel of shadowy ghostwriters. Or at least that’s what Norwegian film-maker Nina Grunfeld believes . “But can a person be so productive and commercially successful in a media industry where nothing is left to coincidence?” Grunfeld asked in an article for the Norwegian newspaper Aftenposten. Grunfeld put forward the theory that the Potter series was in fact written by a large team of people, all of whom were perfectly happy to receive no credit for the worldwide phenomenon. Rowling is an actress they hired to be the face of the series, and her story was cleverly crafted to give hope to impoverished single mothers everywhere. After all, “is it possible that one person can write six thick books that are translated into 55 languages and sell more than 250 million copies in less than 10 years?” Yes, if you have a million-pound paycheck dangling in front of you as motivation. 3) Hunter S Thompson was assassinated According to this internet theory, Thompson knew the truth about 9/11. This “truth” is that it was clearly a ploy to give the “Neo-conservatives their Pearl Harbor,” as the site thompsonmurder.com says, and was entirely organised by the American government. Therefore in 2005, the CIA or the Illuminati or someone, decided Thompson had to be taken down before he shared this knowledge with the world, and so they staged his suicide. Thompson was on the phone with his wife as he died, and he left behind a brief though characteristic suicide note titled Football Season Is Over. According to his friends Thompson had talked of suicide for decades, but the site insists the suicide was clearly staged for a number of reasons including: “He was on good relations with his wife, Anita, a cute young blonde with no problems.” The most convincing cause for suspicion mentioned by thompsonmurder.com, is that the day before he had reportedly told a friend: “They’re gonna make it look like a suicide, I know how these bastards think.” Personally, I wouldn’t put it past Thompson to have said that just to keep us guessing. 4) William Godwin killed Percy Shelley’s first wife Frankenstein author Mary Godwin and poet Percy Shelley began their affair when Mary was 16 and Shelley was still married to his wife Harriet. The pair ran off for a holiday with Lord Byron and his mistress in Geneva, where they launched a contest as to who could write the best horror story, and the manuscript of Frankenstein was begun. While they were away, Harriet Shelley abandoned her child with Percy and went missing. She was discovered a month later, in an advanced stage of pregnancy, floating dead in a lake – an apparent suicide. The incident was relatively hushed up, and Harriet’s name was smeared for years afterward by the Shelleys and Godwins with accusations of alcoholism, infidelity and prostitution. Consipiracy theorists have suggested that Mary’s father, William Godwin - a well-known author - was responsible for Harriet’s demise, basing the theory on the fact that he insisted on Mary and Percy’s wedding happening less than a month after the death, and that he noted Harriet’s death in his diary several weeks before anyone knew she was dead."

    "title": "Sun staff cleared of ‘overarching’ nine-year conspiracy with officials",
    "content": "Six Sun journalists have been cleared of an “overarching” nine-year conspiracy with public officials to commit misconduct in public office, but face remaining charges alleging specific unlawful payments in a criminal trial. The journalists, who include the paper’s former managing editor, news editors and a picture editor, had been accused of paying police, soldiers, prison officials and workers at Broadmoor hospital for a variety of tips and leaks between March 2002 and January 2011. But at the start of Friday’s proceedings in Kingston crown court, judge Peter Marks instructed the jury to formally find the defendants not guilty of count 1, which accused them of an “overarching” nine-year conspiracy. The defendants are Chris Pharo, 45, head of news; Ben O’Driscoll, 38, former deputy news editor; Graham Dudman, 51, former managing editor; John Edwards, 50, picture editor; reporter Jamie Pyatt, 51; and John Troup, 49, former reporter. Marks told jurors that the onus was on the prosecution to provide sufficient evidence that it would be “proper to convict these various defendants of these charges”. He said that after consideration of legal submissions, he had “reached the conclusion as a matter of law that the prosecution have failed in this regard”. Marks also told the jury to find Pharo not guilty of a further charge, count 6, which alleged a conspiracy to pay a serving soldier in the armed forces for a tip about Sandhurst between 12 and 30 April 2006. The defendants still face individual charges relating to allegations of corrupt payments over narrower time periods. With two charges dropped, Pharo now faces four charges of conspiring to commit misconduct in public office. Dudman and O’Driscoll are left fighting three charges while Pyatt and Edwards face two counts and Troup one. All six deny the charges."

With Hugo Blick's The Honourable Woman (Thursdays, BBC2) established as the first non-footballing TV sensation of the summer, Monday sees the return of Channel 4's political paranoia drama Utopia (10pm, Channel 4). Written by Dennis Kelly, whose impressively varied CV includes the stage musical Matilda and the BBC3 comedy Pulling, last year's first series of Utopia received an excited response from social networks, but disapproval from sections of traditional media. There were alarmed articles about scenes of extreme violence in Kelly's portrayal of The Network, a group of provocateurs and assassins – operating in a shadowy area between the state and private enterprise – who seem to be orchestrating world disorder. It's always intriguing to see how a second season responds to a controversy over the first. If this were a BBC show, The Network would probably have turned into an underworld collective of vegetarian pacifists, but Channel 4 seems to have kept its nerve. Indeed, two sequences featuring the bloody killing of pet rabbits (although the most brutal moments are implied rather than dramatised) almost seem calculated to antagonise certain news desks and clean-screen campaigners.\n\nAnd another aspect of Utopia's second run is also notably bold. The first episode of its return is an extended flashback from the opening series, which took place in the present day, to 1974-79. New actors (Aine Garvey and Rose Leslie) play earlier versions of Jessica, a fugitive from the Network, and MI5 agent Milner, who were portrayed in the 2013 episodes (and are again in the later 2014 parts) by Fiona O'Shaughnessy and Geraldine James. This is a clever application by Kelly of the rule of long-running drama that a new series should somehow be the same but different. But the risk-taking comes from the fact that the revelation of the back-story behind the conspiracies involving the \"Utopia manuscript\", \"Rabbit Man\" and \"Janus\" proves to involve a number of actual assassinations from the 70s: Italian prime minister Aldo Moro; the British ambassador to the Netherlands, Richard Sykes; and Margaret Thatcher's chief of staff, Airey Neave, who was blown up at the House of Commons by a bomb placed in his car and is regarded as a sort of martyr by the Thatcherite and Unionist wings of the Conservative party. News reports of these actual murders is cut into the drama – which would provide one ethical discussion for media studies seminars – but, even more debatedly, there is a scene in which Neave, played by Tim McInnerny as a blustering drunk, has dinner with fictional characters as part of a plotline in which his and Sykes' killings are attributed to a conspiracy involving the British and American security services. This characterisation and narrative inflamed the Mail on Sunday, in a report that included calls from Neave's living relatives for Utopia to be withdrawn from broadcast. Although the death of Sykes has commonly been blamed on the IRA – and the INLA publicly claimed responsibility for killing Neave – alternative explanations are not entirely the invention of Dennis Kelly. Some counter-historians have long suggested that Neave (and possibly also Sykes) were killed not by Republican para-militaries but by various combinations of the CIA, MI5 and MI6. The late Enoch Powell was a believer in this scenario, although Powell was also convinced that Shakespeare didn't write Shakespeare's plays, which is rarely a guarantee of credibility. Three and a half decades after the events, a cult Channel 4 drama is unlikely to have much impact on the grief felt by the living friends and relatives of Neave and Sykes and, if it ever became forbidden to speculate widely about the deaths of public figures, there would be large Kennedy and Diana-shaped holes in the British TV schedules. Even so, Neave and Sykes are less public property than the others and the sudden intrusion of these real-death figures into Kelly's enjoyable conspiracy drama gave me a queasy feeling. Possibly in anticipation of another fuss over Utopia, Channel 4 has paired the premiere with another much more Conservative- (and conservative-) friendly project: the start of the eight-part observational documentary series Royal Marine Commando School (Monday, 9pm). Although not without its own potential contentiousness, in scenes of the verbal and physical brutality to which new recruits can be subjected, this series in general seems aimed at almost the opposite of the audience likely to enjoy Utopia. So the suspicion arises that this contrasting double-bill, possibly reflecting the BBC past of current C4 boss Jay Hunt, is a rare example on this network of the BBC practice known as \"sandbagging\", by which shows likely to upset one set of political followers are scheduled close to one likely to appease them. But I may have been watching too many conspiracy thrillers."

    "title": "Argentina's government blames 'conspiracy' for defaulting on debt",
    "content": "Argentina's government was in a defiant mood on Thursday after defaulting on its debt for the second time in 13 years. Economy minister Axel Kicillof, speaking after 11th hour talks with bondholders in New York failed to avert a default, played down the impact it would have on the country's citizens. \"We're not going to sign an agreement that jeopardises the future of all Argentinians,\" he told a press conference in New York. \"Argentinians can remain calm because tomorrow will just be another day and the world will keep on spinning.\" Markets appeared to disagree, with Argentina's Merval share index falling almost 7% on Thursday and the peso down more than 4% against the dollar. Analysts said a fall in Argentina's currency would cause further pain in the country, pushing up the price of imports and driving inflation higher. Steen Jakobsen, chief economist at Saxo Bank, said the fallout would be difficult for a country where inflation is already 12% on official measures and 40% unofficially. \"At a minimum we'll see a loss of GDP of at least 1% if not 2%,\" he said. Argentina was already locked out of international capital markets following its earlier default in late 2001, and Neil Shearing, chief emerging markets economist at Capital Economics, said the latest default would be viewed as a local issue: \"Confirmation that Argentina has officially fallen into default is likely to rattle local markets and has the potential to do significant damage to the domestic economy. But we suspect that contagion to other emerging markets is likely to be limited.\" Argentina has been locked in a decade-long dispute with hold-out investors that the government has described as \"vulture funds\" – a group of US hedge funds led by billionaire Paul Singer's NML Capital, an affiliate of Elliott Management. The vast majority of Argentina's bondholders agreed to debt restructuring deals in 2005 and 2010 following its 2001 default, wiping off more than 70% of the value of their investment but securing regular interest payments. But the holdout investors refused the restructuring and are demanding repayment in full. An instalment of $539m (£319m) was due on the country's restructured bonds on 30 June, which Argentina wanted to pay. The move was blocked, however, by a US judge, Thomas Griesa, who ruled Argentina could not pay the restructured bonds back unless it also paid more than $1.5bn to the holdout investors. Argentina has insisted it cannot afford to do both. A 30-day grace period expired on Wednesday at midnight New York time, meaning Argentina technically defaulted on the restructured bonds. More than 120 economists called on the US Congress to intervene, warning in a letter that Griesa's decision to uphold the holdout investors claim could cause \"unnecessary economic damage to the international financial system, as well as to US economic interests\". In Argentina, the government said the country was the victim of a conspiracy of international financial agents. \"To say we are in default is absurd trickery,\" said cabinet chief minister Jorge Capitanich. \"If the judge is clearly an agent of the vulture funds, if the mediator is an agent of the vulture funds, if the judicial system is infiltrated by the vulture funds, then what kind of justice are you talking to me about?\" Capitanich blamed the US government for failing to intervene against the \"obscene profits\" awarded to hedge funds by the New York court. \"Here there is a responsibility of the United States to generate the conditions for unrestricted respect for the sovereignty of nations. This is Argentina's position, a rational position,\" Capitanich said. Later, after returning from New York, Kicillof said he is willing to hold further talks with holdout investors whose claim for bond payments forced the South American country into default. It was unclear how the situation would be resolved, but Griesa said he would hold a hearing on the case on Friday. There was also speculation that JP Morgan is considering the possibility of buying the holdout bonds. A spokeswoman for the bank declined to comment. News that the late-stage talks had failed was broken by Daniel Pollack, a US court-appointed mediator in the tense negotiations. \"Unfortunately, no agreement was reached and the Republic of Argentina will imminently be in default,\" he said. \"The full consequences of default are not predictable, but they certainly are not positive.\" Stressing the severity of the situation, he added in a statement: \"Default is not a mere \"technical\" condition, but rather a real and painful event that will hurt real people: these include all ordinary Argentine citizens, the exchange bondholders (who will not receive their interest) and the holdouts (who will not receive payment of the judgments they obtained in court).\" Opposition leaders in Argentina scoffed at the government's attempt to deny the country had entered into default. \"It doesn't matter what we say, the world understands we have fallen into default,\" said Rogelio Frigerio of the PRO conservative party and head of the Buenos Aires city bank Banco Ciudad. In the conservative daily La Nación, columinst Joaquín Morales Solá questioned the wisdom of president Cristina Fernández de Kirchner's tactic of denial. \"The government's attitude is unexplainable,\" the columnist wrote. • This article was amended on 5 August 2014 to clarify that a letter to the US Congress was not from the Centre for Economic and Policy Research."

    "title": "Dzhokhar Tsarnaev friend found guilty of conspiracy charges",
    "content": "A jury has found Azamat Tazhayakov guilty of impeding an investigation and conspiracy after he removed a backpack from the dorm room of Boston bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev. Prosecutors said Tazhayakov and his friend Dias Kadyrbayev removed items from Tsarnaev’s dorm room at the University of Massachusetts-Dartmouth a few days after the Boston Marathon bombing last year. Tazhayakov was one of three college friends of Tsarnaev charged following the bombing. Three people were killed and more than 260 injured when two bombs exploded at the finish line of the Boston Marathon in April 2013. Dzhokhar is accused of planting the bombs with his brother, Tamerlan, and leading police on a days-long manhunt in the Boston area. Tazhayakov and Kadyrbayev, who are both from Kazakhstan, were accused of removing the backpack – containing a laptop and fireworks that had been emptied of gunpowder – from Tsarnaev’s room. The pair then allegedly threw the backpack away. Kadyrbayev later told police he threw the backpack into a dumpster near his apartment in New Bedford, Massachusetts, to \"in order to help his friend Tsarnaev avoid trouble”, according to the criminal complaint. Tazhayakov was found not guilty of removing the laptop from Tsarnaev’s room, a separate charge. A third student, Robel Phillipos, allegedly lied to police about his whereabouts on that night, and is charged with making false statements during a terrorism investigation. Police believe he was in Tsarnaev’s apartment. Lawyers for Tazhayakov unsuccessfully argued that Kadyrbayev removed the backpack from Tsarnaev’s room. Prosecutors said both men agreed to remove the items, though Kadyrbayev took the lead, in an effort to protect their friend after Dzhokhar’s image was widely broadcast by the media and FBI, according to the Boston Globe. A 12-member jury in the deliberated for about 15 hours over three days, in the Massachusetts district federal court in Boston. Tazhayakov was the first of those charged in connection to the Boston Marathon bombing to go to trial. Tamerlan Tsarnaev died during a shootout with police in Watertown, Massachusetts, and Dzhokhar is awaiting trial, scheduled to start in October. His attorneys unsuccessfully argued to move his trial, saying he couldn’t get an impartial jury in the Boston area. Kadyrbayev is scheduled to stand trial in September, as is Phillipos. Kadyrbayev and Tazhayakov could face up to five years in jail and a fine of $250,000. Tazhayakov is scheduled to be sentenced in October. Phillipos could face eight years in jail and a $250,000 fine."

    "title": "MH17: five of the most bizarre conspiracy theories | Padraig Reidy",
    "content": "There are several versions of the phrase: “Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity.” While the sentiment is not entirely applicable to the shooting down of Malaysia Airlines’ flight MH17 over Ukraine – it seems impossible that there was no malice involved in bringing down a passenger plane carrying close to 300 people who had nothing to do with anyone’s conflict – it’s still worth holding in our thoughts as we try to get to grips with exactly what happened. Was this a cock-up or a conspiracy? First, the cock-up. Russian-backed Ukrainian separatists gained access to a sophisticated Buk ground-to-air missile system, most likely via Russian channels. They were keen to shoot down Ukrainian planes. Unfortunately, they did not have the equipment or expertise to differentiate between civilian and military aircraft, and the result was the horrific death of MH17’s 298 innocent passengers. This is still a crime, no doubt. But for some this is not enough. For various reasons, ranging from fear, to vanity, to hatred, people need an overarching theory. There must always be more to matters than meets the eye. Here are five of the “alternative” explanations for the downing of MH17, in order of diminishing plausibility (not to suggest that any one of them is really plausible – but some are weirder than others). 1. The Ukrainians did it Straightforward argument: The Ukrainian army should be the best-equipped force in Ukraine. It definitely has Buks, which Russia says it deployed near the separatist militia areas in advance of the attack. It shot down MH17 because…? That’s where this theory falls down. There is no reason why Ukraine, which already has significant sympathy from the international community, would jeopardise its position by senselessly attacking a civilian flight and hoping the blame would stick to Russia. But this is what the Russian military is hinting at with its series of questions to Kiev and Washington released this week. 2. It was the Ukrainians, attempting to shoot down Vladimir Putin Russia’s Interfax agency reported excitedly after the attack that MH17 and Vladimir Putin’s presidential jet had been flying roughly the same trajectory. What’s more, the planes bore strikingly similar markings, with red and blue horizontal stripes on a white fuselage. Could it be the missile was intended for the Russian president? Seems unlikely. Putin’s plane, flying home from a conference in Rio, was not scheduled to fly over Ukraine. Though the paths of the planes did briefly cross, that was apparently near Warsaw. Also, see 1. Unless Ukraine was hellbent on all-out war with Russia, there would be no reason to do this. 3. MH17 was shot down to conceal the truth about HIV/Aids\n\nThis is the point where the theories go from “interesting but unlikely” into “Oh. Right.” Early reports of the disaster suggested over 100 people working in the field of HIV/Aids research, en route to a major international conference in Melbourne, had perished. When a clearer picture emerged, this was revised down to seven. No less horrific for those who perished or their friends and family, but perhaps less grist to the mill of those who speculated that the plane had been shot down to prevent a cure for Aids being revealed. Apparently, the “global elite” is keen to stop us learning about the cure for Aids, as it wants to depopulate the Earth. It seems fair to say that the global elite is not doing a very good job at this. 4. It was Israel Speaking of “global elites”, if one delves far enough (ie not very far at all) into the conspiracy pool, one will quickly find talk of “globalists”, “internationalists”, “banksters” and “Zionists”. The coincidence of the MH17 shooting with the latest outbreak of conflict in Israel/Palestine has provided perfect explanations for many who see the puppetmaster Zionist running everything. Curiously, they never say “Jews run the world” anymore. It is always couched in euphemism. Perhaps this is progress of a sort. But it still means you get to blame Israel for any event anywhere ever. One theory, put forward by James Henry Fetzer of Veterans Today in an interview on Iran’s Press TV, is that Benjamin Netanyahu was behind the disappearance of Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 in March. That plane was then hidden, possibly in Diego Garcia. When the Israeli bombardment of Gaza began, the plane was given new identification numbers and then flown over Ukraine, to be shot down by Ukrainian forces, backed by Nato, which backs Israel, which controls the world and is attempting to undermine Russia, the “last bastion” of the white race against the neocons and Zionists, as former BNP leader Nick Griffin called it in his recent resignation statement. 5. The “Illuminati” did it"

    "title": "Climate sceptics see a conspiracy in Australia's record breaking heat | Graham Readfearn",
    "content": "You could cut the triumphalism on the climate science denialist blogs right now with a hardback copy of George Orwell’s Nineteen Eighty-Four. Their unbridled joy comes not in the wake of some key research published in the scientific literature but in the fact that a climate sceptic has got a mainstream newspaper to give their conspiracy theory another airing. The sceptic in question is Dr Jennifer Marohasy, a long-time doubter of human-caused climate change whose research at Central Queensland University (CQU) is funded by another climate change sceptic. I choose the Nineteen Eighty-Four analogy in my introduction because it is one of Marohasy’s favourites. She likes to compare the work of the Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) to the various goings on in Orwell’s fictional dystopian novel. The conspiracy theory is that BoM is using a technique to selectively tamper with its temperature data so that it better fits with the global warming narrative. The people at NASA are in on it too. Now the great thing about conspiracy theories is that, for believers, attempts to correct the record just serve to reinforce the conspiracy. Like a video clip of the moon landing on a constant loop, the whole thing feeds back on itself. Correspondence posted on Marohasy’s blog shows she has been pushing her claims for months that BoM has “corrupted the official temperature record so it more closely accords with the theory of anthropogenic global warming”, according to a letter she wrote to Liberal Senator Simon Birmingham, whose parliamentary secretary portfolio includes responsibility for the agency. Marohasy lays it on thick in the letter, accusing the bureau of engaging in “propaganda” and littering the text with claims of “corruption”. The Australian’s environment editor Graham Lloyd was approached to cover the “story” and stepped bravely forward with four pieces in recent days covering Marohasy’s claims. Lloyd wrote there was now an “escalating row” over the “competence and integrity” of the BoM despite the fact that Marohasy has not published her claims in a peer reviewed journal (the two papers mentioned in Lloyd’s story actually relate to rainfall prediction, not temperature). Yet this matters not. The climate science denialists, contrarians and anti-environmental culture warriors are lapping it up with headlines like “Australia Government Climate Office Accused Of Manipulating Temperature Data” and “Australian Bureau of Meteorology Accused of Criminally Adjusting Global Warming”. This evening the BoM has released a statement that explains the processes at the bureau. I’ve posted it in full at the bottom of this post, but here’s a quote: Contrary to assertions in some parts of the media, the Bureau is not altering climate records to exaggerate estimates of global warming. Homogenise this The BoM maintains several sets of data on temperatures in Australia and the agency makes all that data available online. One of those datasets is known as the Australian Climate Observations Reference Network – Surface Air Temperature (ACORN-SAT) and this is the one BoM used to declare 2013 was the hottest year on record. Marohasy has been looking at some of the temperature stations that are included in ACORN-SAT and analysing the impact of a method known as “homogenisation” that the BoM sometimes employs with the ACORN-SAT data. It’s no secret or even a revelation that the Bureau of Meteorology employs these techniques and others. On the bureau’s website, anyone is free to lose themselves in a world of homogenised data sets, gridded temperature analysis and temporal homogeneity adjustments. Go for your life. While Marohasy’s central claim – that BoM is doctoring figures to make them more acceptable to a narrative of warming - remains entirely untested in the scientific literature, the bureau’s methods used to compile ACORN-SAT have been peer reviewed. Unusually, the bureau’s full response to one set of questions from Graham Lloyd has found its way onto at least one climate sceptic blog. In the response the bureau explained why three specific site records it was asked about had been homogenised. At Bourke, for example, the station had been moved three times in its history. Detective work had found that a noticeable shift in the readings in the 1950s had likely been due to changes in vegetation around the instrument. At Amberley, the bureau noticed a marked shift in the minimum temperatures it had been recording, which was also likely due to the station being moved. Another site at Rutherglen had data adjusted to account for two intervals – 1966 and 1974 – when its thought the site was moved from close to buildings to low-flat ground. Marohasy wants heads to roll [rolls eyes] because she claims that the Rutherglen site was never moved and so there was no need to homogenise the data. However, the bureau has documentary evidence showing that sometime before the 1970s the weather station was not in the place where it is now. The bureau had initially spotted a break or jump in the data that pointed to a likely move at Rutherglen. Perhaps all of these movements of temperature stations was a conspiracy in itself, cooked up in the 1950s? Professor Neville Nicholls, of Monash University, worked at BoM for more than 30 years and from 1990 until he left in 2005 had led efforts to analyse rainfall and temperature readings from across the country. He told me: The original raw data is all still there – it has not been corrupted. Anyone can go and get that original data. Pre-1910 there was not much of a spread but also there was more uncertainty about how the temperatures were being measured. By 1910, most temperatures were being measured in a Stevenson Screen. A lot of measurements were taken at Post Offices but in many cases these were moved out to airports around the middle of the 20th century. That produces artificial cooling in the data. Towns for example in coastal New South Wales originally had temperatures taken near the ocean because that’s where the town was. But as the town grew the observations would move inland and that is enough to affect temperature and rainfall. Are we supposed to just ignore that? A scientist can’t ignore those effects. It’s not science to just go ahead and plot that raw data. Nicholls said if people didn’t trust the way the BoM was presenting the data they could look elsewhere, such as a major project known as Berkeley Earth undertaken by former sceptic Professor Richard Muller which also used BoM data from as early as 1852 to mid-2013.\n\nSceptic funding Before joining CQU, Marohasy spent many years working at the Institute of Public Affairs – a Melbourne-based free market think tank that has been promoting climate science denialism for more than two decades. After leaving there, she became the chair of the Australian Environment Foundation, a spin-off from the IPA. Marohasy has said that Bryant Macfie, a Perth-based climate science sceptic, funds her research at Central Queensland University. In 2008, after Macfie had gifted $350,000 to the University of Queensland in a donation facilitated by the IPA to pay for environmental research scholarships there, he wrote that science had been corrupted by a “newer religion” of environmentalism. In June, Marohasy made her claims about BoM to the Sydney Institute. In July she travelled to Las Vegas to speak at the Heartland Institute’s gathering of climate science denialists and assorted contrarians. The Heartland Institute is the “free market” think tank that once ran a billboard advert with a picture of terrorist and murderer Ted “Unabomber” Kaczynski alongside the question: “I still believe in Global Warming. Do You?” Also speaking in Las Vegas was federal MP for the Queensland electorate of Dawson, George Christensen, who appeared on a panel alongside Marohasy. Christensen described mainstream climate science as “a lot of fiction dressed up as science”. Data shows warming Dr Lisa Alexander, the chief investigator at the ARC Centre of Excellence for Climate System Science, explained that in Australia it was not uncommon for temperature stations to be moved, often away from urban environments. She said that, for example, sites moved only a kilometre or so to more exposed areas such as airports would tend to record lower temperatures. That then creates a jump in the time series that’s not related to a jump in the climate. The bureau is altering the temperature data to remove those non-climatic effects that are due to changes like new instrumentation or site movements. Is the bureau fiddling the figures to fit with a global warming conspiracy? No! Are they amending the records to make them consistent through time? Yes. Also included in the BoM’s statement comes the following graph that overlays 18 different sets of temperature data for Australia - including (in yellow) another BoM dataset which is not homogenised. The graph also includes temperature measurements by satellite. Now either the satellites are also in on the warming conspiracy, or there’s something else going on. I wonder what that might be?"

    "title": "Secret Teacher: I'm caught in a performance-pay conspiracy",
    "content": "Dear Headteacher, Thank you for the kind feedback you gave me on my lesson observation that took place two weeks before the end of the school year when I and my students are at our most exhausted. I welcome the fact that whereas all my other observations this year have been \"good to outstanding\", you still deem me as \"requires improvement\". Although you don't intend on acting on this before the summer holiday, action will be taken in the new academic year, which presumably means you will not consider me to go through threshold as an M6 teacher which would require you to pay me more. I am grateful for your guidance regarding my learning objectives – this was helpful although you did fail to spot the subtle differentiation I had put in place, dismissing the eight sheets that I had carefully prepared, each with individual scaffolds to help students achieve their next step. Implying that my outcomes are too simplistic, your comments that students carry out science investigations all the time and therefore couldn't possibly be progressing, just revealed an inherent lack of understanding of my subject. Who knows why science devotes a whole 25% of a GCSE to that skill when any monkey should be able to do it? Despite previous assessments and my work scrutiny, you feel I am not adequately getting students to respond to my feedback – a point you couldn't let rest and patronisingly pronounced that I have been told to act on many times before. Beyond this being an appraisal target that all members of the science department were assigned, it's also simply untrue; feedback has been recognised previously as one of my strengths. You held up one honourably unnamed member of staff in praise – you had checked one set of her books last week and she had more marking in there than me. But there was no mention that you were checking a set of books for a group she sees once a fortnight compared to the group I see six times a fortnight . You also failed to find a copy of my most recent work scrutiny (what used to be a useful tool to identify good practice is now a bi-annual beating that ensures we are pushing ourselves to the edge with marking in fear of being held to account for slacking). Had this come to hand, it would have highlighted my efforts to engage the students in responding to feedback so it's curious that you misplaced this key bit of evidence. It feels like you're trying to subvert my appraisal like you did last year and the year before so I can't progress through threshold. Between you and me, I think you are a bully. You are the only person with the ability to back me into a corner and leave me inarticulate and shaken. You phrase your reflective questions in a patronising and personal way – \"I'd expect those mistakes to be made by an NQT but you have been teaching for six years and it is just not good enough\". You don't listen to me when I try and explain myself. If I was to act this way towards a child, I would be gutted at the affect you have on my confidence and motivation. I know I don't help myself by turning to a waffling jelly every time you step a foot into my classroom but at the end of the day you are the person whose opinion I value the most and the fact that you are dismissing me as \"requires improvement\" and moving the goalposts every time I make some improvement leaves me with little hope for career progression. What I really want you to do is trust me. Trust that you and I are singing from the same song sheet. Trust my appraisers and my head of department that they are making the right judgements about me – that I am genuinely doing as good a job I can and not urge them to change their judgements on my targets like you did last year and the year before. Understand that with a 45-hour-a-fortnight timetable, I make the odd mistake and have the odd bad lesson; I am not trying to pull the wool over your eyes or being lazy or intentionally sabotaging the learning in my lessons. And the last really galling point – there are plenty of teachers who have gone through the threshold in earlier years who have never had to pull rabbits out of hats and who are currently contributing far less to the education of the young people at the school than I am and are being paid a lot more than me and always will be.

    "title": "The Conspiracy makes paranoia fun again",
    "content": "Faux-documentary The Conspiracy pulls off two tricks that alone warrant 82 crisply compelling minutes of your time: it makes conspiracy theories fun again (or perhaps it just makes them funny, as well as quite scary); and it finds new life in the increasingly threadbare found-footage genre. Two small-scale Canadian documentarians named Aaron Poole and Jim Gilbert – the actors' real names – are profiling a conspiracy theorist named Terrance, who bears a žižek-y resemblance to those derelicts you see waving tin cups on freeway off-ramps, but who is building his own unified field theory of every conspiracy ever out of newspaper clippings, push-pins and pieces of string on his apartment wall. When Terrance disappears, the more credulous Aaron develops his theories, while Jim the sceptic holds his tongue. Key recurring elements lead them to the secretive Tarsus Group, some unspeakable combination of the Parallax Corporation, the Carlyle and Bilderberg groups, the Illuminati, and the orgiastic overdogs of Eyes Wide Shut. Their hidden hand, Aaron comes to believe, can be discerned at work in the run-up to history's most momentous events. The film-makers' obsession with Tarsus leads them to infiltrate, with concealed mini-cams, one of the the group's highly secret bacchanalian gatherings of the obscenely rich and the monumentally powerful, all reminiscent of the nude male powermonger frolics at Bohemian Grove each summer. What's interesting is that the conspiracy theories themselves don't matter that much. Some of them are rightwing and delusional, others leftwing and ditto. Writer-director Christopher MacBride seems more interested in the paranoid mindset itself, that delicious frisson of fear and panicked exhilaration that sets in when paranoia bites deep. His characters have their apartments turned over and are followed in the streets by mysterious black SUVs and fascistic-looking bicyclists – and being documentary makers, they document everything. Armed with tie-pin cameras, they crash the seemingly benign and polite super-secret retreat, naive enough to still consider themselves the hunters and not the prey. The Conspiracy is intentionally cheap-looking, with a lot of different stocks and exposure levels, occlusions and blackouts, but MacBride turns his apparently meagre resources into a movie that's both plausible and watchable (and not merely in the sense that all his moving cameras don't induce nausea in the viewer). It can be faulted for its predictability, but the film-making is surefooted and confident. It's a movie for anyone who secretly fears (yet also craves) the idea that 10 powerful men in a single room control the universe. Well, don't they?"

    "content": "Until this week, X marked the spots. But on Tuesday a steamroller trundled up and down the road near the building best known as the Texas school book depository, smoothing out a brand-new surface with its smart black asphalt and freshly painted straight white lines. City workers are re-laying the street. \"I guess they don't want any special visitors to see the Xs,\" said Robert Groden as he sat on the grassy knoll at a table stacked with copies of his DVD, The Case For Conspiracy. The New Yorker was a photographic consultant to the House select committee on assassinations in the mid-1970s and also provided input to Oliver Stone's 1991 movie, JFK. He moved to Dallas two decades ago and comes to Dealey Plaza most days, selling his DVDs and books. He claims responsibility for taping white crosses along Elm Street that for years tempted camera-wielding tourists out into the road, dodging traffic on the three-lane artery so they could say they were there, standing in the path of the bullet(s) that changed the world.\n\nFriday ought to be one of the most important days of his life. It is the 50th anniversary of John F Kennedy's death, as well as Groden's 68th birthday. The city is hosting a commemoration in Dealey Plaza for dignitaries and 5,000 members of the public who won their tickets in a ballot. Groden said he will be there as an accredited journalist. But like other conspiracy theorists, he does not feel welcome. \"It's very late in the day for this damn city to all of a sudden pretend that they care about what happened to the president. For 49 years people like myself have been out here trying to keep the issues alive, respectfully giving a moment of silence for the president and now that it's the magic 50th, the city decides they want to take it over,\" he said. Dallas civic leaders have arranged an hour-long ceremony called \"The 50th\" that will \"set a solemn, dignified and understated tone as we commemorate the life, legacy and leadership of President John F Kennedy,\" mayor Mike Rawlings said in a statement. There will be speeches, hymns, a flypast and a moment of silence at 12.30pm, the time of the shooting. Attendees have been background-checked by Dallas police. Security will be tight, dissenters and demonstrators are unwelcome. With the world's media in attendance, for the theorists this is akin to being asphyxiated within touching distance of an oxygen tank. The fight over who may stand in this small section of downtown Dallas on Friday has come to symbolise the decades-long friction between authorities and truthers. Understandably, after half a century, many in Dallas would like this anniversary to be an orderly and tasteful form of closure, the point when history was finally left in the past. The conspiracy theorists want precisely the opposite: for the attention to spark more debate, greater openness, extra focus on whatever they happen to believe. In the absence of any previous official city event, November 22 has always been their day, the plaza their place. The city \"had Dealey Plaza all these years and they didn't take advantage of it,\" said Debra Conway, co-founder of JFK Lancer, a historical research company that believes there was more than one shooter. Conway is organising a conference for 400 people in Dallas this week. She will watch the ceremony on television. \"They're just on lockdown, they don't want us there and I have no desire to get arrested,\" she said. \"They're not acknowledging that somebody died there.\""

    "title": "CIA suppressed Kennedy facts, 'but there was no conspiracy'",
    "content": "The CIA and FBI withheld information about Cuba and Lee Harvey Oswald from the Warren commission into John Kennedy's assassination, one of the commission's surviving staff members has acknowledged. Nevertheless the inquiry did establish the truth, said Richard Mosk, a California court of appeal justice who served on the commission. He said the agencies' lack of full disclosure was unfortunate but did not alter the fact that Oswald acted alone. \"It was an easy shot.\" Mosk, speaking on the eve of the 50th anniversary of the November 22 1963 assassination, said there were no additional gunmen and no conspiracy. \"Nothing came from the grassy knoll.\" Speaking to the Guardian from his chambers in downtown Los Angeles, Mosk, 74, lamented that conspiracy theorists used anniversaries to assail the 888-page report, which he called one of history's most extensive and thorough criminal investigations. \"It's aggravating. It's not pleasant to have the Warren commission tarred and feathered every 10 to 15 years.\" President Lyndon Johnson appointed chief justice Earl Warren to chair the commission seven days after the murder. Mosk, then a 24-year-old attorney from a politically connected California family, was for a time the youngest staff member. Top-secret security clearance gave him full access to the investigation. The commission worked 12 hours a day, seven days a week, for 10 months, he said. \"The chief justice told me truth was our only client.\" Countless books and films have challenged the report on the grounds it was misled. Mosk acknowledged federal authorities kept the commission partly in the dark. \"For example, yes, the FBI held back information that they had certain contacts with Oswald prior to the assassination. \"And maybe had they followed through, the assassination would not have taken place. But that doesn't have any bearing on whether he did it or whether there was a conspiracy.\" The Central Intelligence Agency apparently did not fully cooperate either, he said. \"The CIA may have withheld information concerning the United States' activities vis-a-vis Cuba. Again, it would have been nice [to know] and should have been disclosed but there was nothing further that the commission could have done. We investigated the possibility of Cuban involvement to the fullest extent possible.\" The information, later revealed, would have made no difference to the central findings, said the judge. \"It would have been nice to know but it doesn't affect the conclusions.\" Asked why the FBI and CIA withheld information he said he could only speculate that it was for national security or to protect themselves. Even the simplest car accident case generated conflicting evidence so it was normal the JFK investigation did so too. \"There will always be some inconsistencies in any factual determination. You have to consider the totality of evidence.\" He had no doubt Oswald fired all three shots at the president's motorcade from the sixth floor of a school book depository overlooking the cavalcade's route through Dallas. \"He was a marine marksman. He was a hunter when he was a kid. When he was in Russia he practised with this rifle.\" It was a much closer distance than many people realised, said Mosk, who has visited the depository. \"It was an easy shot. You have to see it to appreciate that. Even I would have had no trouble making that shot.\" Alternative theories which mushroomed after the Warren report fuelled suspicion and distrust of institutions. Mosk said it was \"deplorable\" that Warner Brothers sent \"false history\" kits to schools to promote Oliver Stone's 1991 film JFK. Publishers made fortunes with conspiracy books but often amateur sleuths sincerely wanted to unlock what they thought was a cover-up. \"Many are well-meaning. They're not out to make money. But nevertheless they're barking up the wrong tree.\" He regretted that a plaque at the book depository said this was where Oswald \"allegedly\" shot the president. However books such as Vincent Bugliosi's 1,632-page opus, Reclaiming History, had helped restore public faith in the Warren commission. Mosk said he had every incentive to discover the truth about that day in Dallas. He had met JFK and his father Stanley, a former California attorney general and state supreme court, campaigned for him. \"When you look at films of Kennedy speaking you can't help but wish he would have been able to continue.\""

    "title": "John F Kennedy: 50th anniversary of a conspiracy theory | Chris French",
    "content": "Fifty years ago today, President John F Kennedy, one of the most charismatic leaders of modern times, was gunned down by a lone gunman in Dallas, Texas. Or was he? The majority of people in the US and many people around the world doubt the \"official story\" and instead believe that JFK was, in fact, the victim of a conspiracy involving members of the mob. Or the CIA. Or communists. Or extreme right-wingers. Or the military-industrial complex. The list goes on. The idea that JFK was not the victim of a lone deranged gunman has been referred to as the \"mother of all conspiracy theories\" although some might argue that this accolade should nowadays go to the claim that 9/11 was an inside job. Although these two conspiracies are probably the most widely held, a wide variety of other conspiracy theories are also endorsed by large proportions of the population. These include the idea that Princess Diana was murdered, that the Americans never actually landed on the moon, that the HIV/Aids virus was deliberately manufactured with genocidal intent, and that the world is, in fact, ruled by giant shape-shifting lizards. What is it about conspiracy theories that makes them so attractive to so many people? And why is it that some people are more drawn to such theories than others? One possibility, of course, is that all of the above conspiracy theories are true and based upon a cool and rational analysis of available evidence. The only reason that some people do not believe in them might be because they have not looked at the evidence and instead, like mindless sheep, have simply accepted the lies of the establishment. This seems highly unlikely. For one thing, in this internet age with instant access to rolling news, conspiracy theories arise almost instantly after any major event, often far too quickly for any evidence to have been properly gathered and analysed regarding the real cause of the event in question. Secondly, studies have shown that some people will, upon first encountering them, endorse entirely fictional conspiracies dreamt up by researchers with no supporting evidence whatsoever. Finally, those with a strong inclination towards conspiratorial thinking will even endorse mutually contradictory conspiracy theories. Thus, those who believe that Princess Diana was murdered by the British secret service are also more likely to believe that she faked her own death; those who believe that Osama bin Laden was in fact already dead at the time that the Americans claim to have killed him are also more likely to believe that he is still alive. The explanation is, of course, that those with a conspiratorial mindset are not exactly sure what really happened with respect to these dramatic events. The only thing they are sure of is that the \"official story\" is not true. Surprisingly, with a few notable exceptions, it is only recently that psychologists have turned their attention towards this fascinating topic but there are signs this has changed in recent years, with an increasing number of relevant publications and publication of special issues of journals and blogs devoted exclusively to this topic. Some interesting findings have already emerged. For example, it appears that one of the underlying cognitive factors that inclines us towards belief in conspiracy theories is our intuitive notion that big events must have big causes. This has been referred to as the proportionality bias. Thus we find it hard to accept that JFK was the victim of a lone deranged gunman or that Princess Diana was the victim of a drunk driver. We prefer the idea that such major events must have major causes – such as complex conspiracies by groups of powerful individuals. Other research has pointed to the relevance of the psychological mechanism of projection. It appears that some people are more inclined to believe in conspiracies than others because those people would themselves feel inclined to engage in conspiracies in similar contexts. The reasoning goes like this: \"If I were in that situation, I would probably engage in conspiratorial behaviour. That implies that most people would do likewise. Therefore, this conspiracy probably really did take place.\" Another factor that plays an important role is confirmation bias, probably the most ubiquitous cognitive bias of them all. We all have a tendency to pay more attention to evidence that supports what we already believe or want to be true and to ignore, neglect or dismiss evidence that contradicts of favoured beliefs. In one study, participants were presented with information relating to the JFK assassination. Some of the information was more consistent with the lone gunman explanation, some was more consistent with the conspiracy-based explanation. All participants found the information that was consistent with their pre-existing views more convincing than information that was inconsistent with those views. Thus the presentation of the same information had a polarising effect: those who already believed in the conspiracy theory believed in it even more strongly; those who already rejected the conspiracy theory, rejected it even more strongly. In real life, information about major events is often complex and includes errors and anomalies, meaning that such contradictory interpretations are all too easy. One of our greatest strengths as a species is our ability to find patterns and connections in complex data and to perceive cause and effect relationships between events. The problem is that we sometimes see patterns when they are not really there and deduce cause and effect relationships where they do not exist. Not surprisingly perhaps, those who believe strongly in conspiracies tend to show higher levels of anomie and paranoia. It is not just that they do not trust governments and official institutions. They are also less likely to trust their next-door neighbours and their colleagues at work. They tend to feel powerless, the victims of uncontrollable external forces, and it is arguably the case that belief in conspiracies gives them at least the illusion of control. Identifying at out-group as the cause of one's misfortune – be it the government, the CIA, the Illuminati or whatever – means there is at least the possibility that this enemy can be defeated. It is also undeniably satisfying to believe that one is in possession of secret knowledge about the way things really are that others are either too stupid or ignorant to believe. It should be noted that none of the psychologists engaged in this line of research would for one minute maintain that all conspiracy theories are false. A tiny minority of such theories do turn out to be true. The focus of this research is not upon whether any specific conspiracy theory is true or false but instead upon trying to understand the factors that make such theories so easy to believe for so many people. A second focus is upon why some people are more drawn to belief in conspiracies, even entirely fictional or mutually contradictory ones, than others. In the final analysis though, does belief in conspiracy theories do any real damage? Isn't it the case that such beliefs are just a bit of harmless fun? Although that may be true of belief in most conspiracy theories, the evidence shows conclusively that belief in conspiracies can cause serious harm. For example, it is estimated that unfounded conspiracy-based beliefs in the alleged dangers of treatment for Aids has cost hundreds of thousands of lives. It has also been shown that terrorist groups use conspiracy theories to recruit and motivate their followers. Finally, belief in conspiracy theories is associated with disengagement from democratic processes making believers less likely to vote, for example. In a democracy, it is essential that citizens examine and question the official version of events if we are to hold our leaders to account when it is appropriate to do so. But proper scepticism does not entail the rejection of all official versions of events but careful rational analysis using critical thinking skills to maximum effect. The assumption that all information from official sources is untrue is a dangerous road to go down. • Chris French is a professor of psychology at Goldsmiths, University of London, where he heads the Anomalistic Psychology Research Unit.

    "title": "The great big Pixar conspiracy",
    "content": "Anyone can swan up to the Back to the Future trilogy and point out, after a single watch, that the grand finale is flawed: Doc and Marty would be better off extracting petrol from the buried DeLorean. No doubt it took a bit longer to formulate the ticklish notion that Edward Norton's nameless schizophrenic in Fight Club is a grown-up Calvin from Calvin and Hobbes. I love that a blunt single sentence can debunk Disney's Aladdin. But the very best fan theories – the fan theories you can waste weeks picking over – take a broader view. They're ambitious. Maybe they find unexamined joins in a directors' oeuvre. (That heightened pop-culture awareness shared by characters in Tarantino films – could it all be due to a key choice of location in Inglourious Basterds?) Maybe they take in decades' worth of material. (Are Bonds Connery through Craig actually a bunch of different agents who only shared a famous code name? And did one of them end up in Alcatraz?). I salute the eager, time-rich men and women who developed these theories. Until this week I'd never seen anyone put forward something that attempted to unite a studio's entire output. Step forward Jon Negroni, a blogger who, inspired by a video on Cracked.com, wrote up a vast hypothesis that links every Pixar film from Toy Story to Monsters University. According to Negroni, all 14 of the studio's films are interdependent. The talking dogs in Up connect to the cooking rodent in Ratatouille. A glimpsed logo in Toy Story 3 foreshadows the global collapse of Wall-E. Negroni calls his opus the Pixar Theory. Give it a few minutes (or hours, or weeks) of your time here.\n\nFor those who can't face all 4,500 words, here's a summary. Negroni suggests that everything in every Pixar film takes place in one universe, albeit at different periods in this universe's history. Magic unearthed in Brave – the stuff that turns Emma Thompson's character into a bear – ultimately evolves and spreads, creating the talking fish of Finding Nemo and every other human-like animal in Pixar's universe. Technology developed by the villain in The Incredibles kick-starts a world with self-aware toys like Buzz Lightyear and chatty cars like Lightning McQueen. It gets knottier. There are no people in Cars because they've been driven out. Sentient objects, fed up with being used and loved and discarded by humans (as per the Toy Story trilogy), have revolted. Thus Wall-E, where the humans that remain live on a spaceship, and Earth, which has been left to machines, has become a lifeless dump. In his most daring move, Negroni places A Bug's Life at the end of his Pixar chronology – after the events of Wall-E that, you'll remember, concludes with a hopeful end-credit sequence in which a tree is planted on Earth. The tree, he points out, looks very similar to the one at the beginning of A Bug's Life. True, Negroni stutters a bit with Monsters, Inc. (discussion turns to \"super species\", and there's also some worrying stuff about human-animal interbreeding), but he just about makes room for the film and its sequel, and he eagerly anticipates next year's Pixar offering, The Good Dinosaur, wondering what extra layers it might add. Toy Story 3's Lotso Huggin' Bear as a political visionary? Monsters, Inc.'s Boo as a time-travelling witch? The Incredibles' Omnidroid as Woody's forefather? It's all in there. If the above names mean nothing to you, of course, Negroni's theory will read like a troubling waste of a grownup's time. To Pixar nuts as well as fans of fan theory, this is medal-worthy stuff. For the record, Negroni himself seems torn as to the value of his work. \"Half of me believes [Pixar] totally did this from the get-go since they are more than capable of doing something so amazing,\" he told Entertainment Weekly, which wrote up the project. \"While the other half of me realizes that this is my love for Pixar movies manifesting itself in over-the-top conspiracy theories.\""

    "content": "Julian Borger (Can Russia push Syria to disarm?, 10 September) analyses many aspects of the possibility of Assad relinquishing chemical weapons. What would Syria gain from such a deal? Might it be that Russia has promised a continued, or even increased, supply of conventional weapons, making the end of the civil war killings no nearer? Russia, having brokered the deal, achieves a stronger position to continue to take Syria's side in the UN security council. So, the conflict is prolonged. Michael Shaw Huddersfield • Historians generally fall into two schools: the conspiracy theorists who believe there is an underlying plot behind everything and the cock-up theorists who think historical events are merely the result of accident and happenchance. Over the past fortnight the chaotic machinations of the world's powers over Syria demonstrate that both schools of thought are valid. From David Cameron's bungled recall of parliament, which forced Obama's hand in Congress, to John Kerry's slip of the tongue, which was seized on by Sergei Lavrov, our wrong-headed leaders have been wrong-footing each other in their efforts to shape the future of Syria, the region and the world. Stefan Simanowitz London • Whatever the future direction of US policy on Syria, the clear fact is that the UK parliament's no vote to military action caused a swift rethink on intervention. Remember Iraq, when the warmongers said the US was going in anyway so it would serve our interests to be alongside? Nick Edmunds Twickenham, Middlesex • In all the harrowing debates about military intervention in Syria, one aspect has not been mentioned: the reaction of the victims and their families, carers and doctors/nurses. A punitive action against Assad would give a small boost to their morale; they would no longer feel abandoned by the rest of the world. Christina Naylor Brittany, France"

    "title": "JFK: why do people believe in conspiracy theories? Because conspiracies happen | Oliver Burkeman",
    "content": "The 50th anniversary of the assassination of John F Kennedy has been accompanied by a lot of soul-searching about the fact that a majority of Americans – and presumably millions of people elsewhere – believe we still don't know the whole story about the shooting. Demolishing conspiracy theories is, quite justifiably, a favourite pursuit of the self-styled \"skeptic\" movement, and psychological explanations of the phenomenon abound. There's evidence that people who feel socially powerless are prone to a conspiracist mindset; in an increasingly complex world, we're told, paranoid speculations are a way to reassert a feeling of agency and control; the echo-chambers of the modern media reinforce bizarre beliefs, protecting them from challenge. All true, no doubt, as underlined by conspiracists' embarrassing tendency to believe simultaneously in mutually contradictory conspiracies. People who believe Princess Diana was murdered, it turns out, are also more likely to believe she faked her own death. But this kind of psychological explanation, however valid, always runs the risk of curdling into a kind of condescension, in which the critics of some social malaise imply that their grasp of reality must obviously be superior to the sufferers'. So if only as an exercise in humility, it's worth remembering that one of the many reasons people believe in conspiracies is because conspiracies actually happen. This marks a crucial difference between conspiracy theorism and some of the psychological delusions with which it's frequently grouped. Disembodied voices don't ever occur outside a disordered mind; people who are convinced they were Napoleon in a previous life, or who believe they have telepathic powers, or that terrible accidents will befall those they think bad thoughts about, are all always wrong. (Or put it this way: if they're not, we'd have to radically overhaul our most basic assumptions about the world.) Whereas people who think government agencies or other shady groups are engaged in elaborate schemes to delude the general population for nefarious ends are only usually mistaken. Just to be clear, I'm not suggesting there was any conspiracy to kill JFK. (Shall I say that again? I'm not suggesting there was any conspiracy to kill JFK.) But as Fred Kaplan pointed out recently in an excellent essay at Slate, devoted mainly to debunking the main Dallas conspiracy theories, it wasn't exactly insane to have a conspiracist mindset about politics in the 1960s: Back in 1971, not long before he died, a retired Lyndon B Johnson told the journalist Leo Janos that the Kennedy administration had been “running a damn Murder Incorporated in the Caribbean.” Nobody knew what he was talking about at the time. A few years later, the Church Committee revealed the details of Operation Mongoose — an intense plot by the Kennedy White House and the CIA to assassinate Fidel Castro. Revelations also emerged of the mafia’s cooperation in Mongoose, of JFK’s affair with a mafia moll, and of his brother Robert Kennedy’s crusade against the same mafia kingpins. Could Dallas have been a revenge shooting, mounted by either Castro or the mafia? Even if Oswald had been the lone gunman, could he have been a recruit in some larger power’s plot? There are many other examples. There's persuasive evidence that the US army really did test potentially damaging chemicals by spraying them around poor neighbourhoods of St Louis during the Cold War; the Tuskegee Syphilis Experiment really did take place; a group of wealthy American businessmen probably really did discuss a coup to unseat FDR; the CIA really did covertly fund modern American art in an effort to combat the menace of Soviet realism. None of this, it ought to go without saying, adds credibility to the chemtrail theory or the \"global warming scam\" or the vast labyrinths of 9/11 Truther lore. But they offer a partial explanation for conspiracy-mindedness that's not based on some deep psychological weakness. Then there's the problem of how much gets encompassed by the phrase \"conspiracy theorist\". It refers sometimes to deeply unpleasant bigots, determined to find evidence for their anti-semitic or otherwise repugnant prejudices; to people who honestly seem to believe that the administration of George W Bush was able to stage an epic, multi-pronged cover-up over 9/11, yet was somehow unable to stop a twentysomething from upstate New York distributing a web documentary exposing the fact. (The most withering response to that idea can be found here.) Then there are the sceptics who just think there are some \"unanswered questions\" about the JFK assassination, or 9/11, etcetera. Not only are these people not true-believer conspiracists; they're not even incorrect. Of course there'll always be unanswered questions, untied-up loose ends, about any momentary event that shifts the course of history – if only because we subject such moments to such relentless scrutiny. Combine that fact with the reality of at least a few alleged conspiracies, and it's not so strange or irrational to wonder if there's a story behind the story. In some sense or other – usually mundane, occasionally sinister – there often is."

    "title": "The Parallax View: a JFK conspiracy film that gets it right",
    "content": "Just about the only interesting things about the new Hollywood movie Parkland is its demonstration of how far Hollywood has shifted to the right over the last couple of decades. John F Kennedy was quite a conservative president. He opposed the March on Washington and did little to promote the cause of civil rights, whereas Hollywood celebrities as diverse as Marlon Brando, Charlton Heston, and Steve McQueen joined the march and heard Martin Luther King discuss his dream. Nevertheless Kennedy's murder sent shockwaves through the liberal Los Angeles community. The humourist Mort Sahl remarked that Kennedy was \"shot like a dog on the streets of Dallas, and all of a sudden he had no friends\". After a couple of films in 1967 – the documentary Rush to Judgment and Bruce Conner's experimental short film Report – that critiqued the Warren commission's findings, in 1973 a Hollywood feature called Executive Action arrived. It mixed documentary footage with live action, and portrayed the assassination as a conspiracy by the CIA and big business interests. Executive Action is a decent, strangely low-key film; what's interesting is just how mainstream it was. Burt Lancaster played the CIA coup leader, while Robert Ryan and Will Geer played Texas oil men who want Kennedy dead. Dalton Trumbo, once blacklisted, wrote the script, and the film was directed by David Miller, whose CV contains another good picture, Lonely Are the Brave. Hollywood later revisited the Kennedy assassination with Winter Kills (1979), based on Richard Condon's paranoid thriller; Ruby (1992), a stumbling biopic about Lee Harvey Oswald's killer Jack Ruby; and most famously in 1991 with JFK, Oliver Stone's epic mega-budget version of events. JFK is a hagiography of Kennedy theorist Jim Garrison, a bombastic New Orleans prosecutor and homophobe who tried to convict a gay CIA associate, Clay Shaw, of the president's murder. Garrison's case was ultimately unconvincing: a jury found Shaw innocent, which undercuts Stone's telling of history. Nevertheless, the film provoked a public outcry and led to the release of thousands of previously secret files by the Assassination Records Review board. For my money, the best JFK conspiracy movie isn't, strictly speaking, about the Kennedy assassination. Made in 1974, Alan J Pakula's The Parallax View borrows from the murders of both Kennedy brothers to tell the tale of a mysterious organisation, the Parallax Corporation, which deals in political assassination and the creation of \"lone assassin\" patsies.\n\nReading on mobile? Click here to view trailer The reader will recall that Lee Harvey Oswald, during his brief time in the custody of the Dallas police, denied murdering the president and cried out to reporters: \"I'm a patsy! I'm a patsy!\" – strange behaviour for someone who, according to Parkland and the Warren Report, killed Kennedy to become famous. The Parallax View, written by David Giler, Lorenzo Semple Jr and an uncredited Robert Towne, describes how such patsies are created. Pakula was, like David Miller, a mainstream director whose filmography fails to excite. Also like Miller, he has one excellent credit: Klute. In many ways, The Parallax View outshines even that fine thriller. Parallax begins with the murder of a politician on the campaign trail in Seattle's Space Needle, followed by the near-instant death of the alleged assassin. An investigative journalist digs deeper into the seemingly open-and-shut case and masquerades as a malcontented loser-drifter to get \"inside\" the Parallax Corporation. There are parallels with The Manchurian Candidate, but Parallax is even better than John Frankenheimer's thriller about a programmed assassin – mainly thanks to the lead actor, Warren Beatty, who gives what is possibly the best performance of his career, as a hipster journalist masquerading as a malleable psychotic. There are multiple twists and pitfalls. Created at a time when Hollywood still dared to challenge the \"official\" version of events, this is not a feel-good film. Instead, it's one of the high points of the New American Cinema, that brief decade when American film was still an art form – and a challenging, subversive art form at that. That period was a far cry from sorry 2013, when Tom Hanks produces pointless films like Parkland and does voiceovers for the Pentagon-friendly National WWII War Museum, in New Orleans.

    "title": "Norman Baker: finally the conspiracy theorists have an inside man | Jonathan Freedland",
    "content": "It could come as early as today, the first ministerial meeting of the newly reshuffled team at the Home Office – and what wouldn't the Westminster press corps give to be flies on that wall? The room will be airless with tension. In the chair will be the home secretary, Theresa May, said to be \"spitting tacks\" over the appointment – without her approval or even consultation – of Lib Dem Norman Baker as her No 2. Will she give a terse welcome to Baker, through a rictus grin? Or will she all but pretend he's not there, the first step to freezing him out altogether? Will Baker himself try to clear the air? And what about everyone else, the other ministers and their civil servants: will they simply stare at their feet? The problem, you see, is not only that Baker was imposed on May by Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg in Monday's reshuffle. The problem is that Baker is, as Sir Humphrey might put it, a brave choice for the Home Office, the department that deals with public safety. For Baker is what you'd call a conspiracy theorist, one so dedicated he took a year out of frontline politics to write a book suggesting the former government weapons inspector Dr David Kelly did not commit suicide in 2003 but was in fact murdered by an Iraqi hit squad, a crime known to, but secretly covered up by, the UK authorities. Most who have studied the question believe that's nonsense: indeed the one finding of Lord Hutton's public inquiry that few disputed was that Kelly had taken his own life. But Baker remains unconvinced. As the Guardian's Nicholas Watt and Rowena Mason report, Baker has also spoken publicly of his doubts over the death of Robin Cook, seeing mystery in the fact that the one-time foreign secretary – who resigned his cabinet post over Iraq – died while out walking \"on Ministry of Defence land\". Baker is of course not the first man prone to seeing secret plots and shadowy schemes in every corner – but he is the first such man to be in charge of the national crime agency, drug and alcohol policy and forensic science. Officials in the latter area especially should brace themselves for some unusually detailed questioning. One wonders if the new minister will seek to take full advantage of his position. Perhaps he might call up the classified papers on the death of Princess Diana, just to give those a quick once-over. He might put in a call to his opposite number in Washington DC, asking for a peek inside the US government files on the so-called \"moon landing\" of 1969 or finally get to the truth of what really happened to JFK that day in Dallas. Forget the political interpretations of Baker's move – perhaps a gesture by Clegg to the left-leaning, woolly-hat wing of the Lib Dems or else an attempt to cut down a potential rival in Baker's predecessor Jeremy Browne. The real significance of Baker's appointment is for the global movement of conspiracy theorists. For the first time they have someone on the inside of the government machine! At last he can discover the truth! Unless, of course, this is all a trick by the authorities – and that's exactly what they want us to think."

The announcement came as the prime minister was answering questions in the Commons on the row and amid calls for Mitchell to be reinstated in a senior government position. The statement reveals the growing nature of the inquiry. On Tuesday, the Met commissioner, Bernard Hogan-Howe, said the investigation would be over before Christmas, but on Wednesday his force said \"the investigation will not be short\". Police said in their statement that the investigation by their Department of Professional Standards began after new information was received last Thursday. It will examine who leaked purported details of a clash between Mitchell and police in Downing Street in September. The Metropolitan police investigation will examine if the leak to the media came from officers or, \"alternatively, if the source of the leak was via a third party\", and \"establish who that was and how it was done\". The inquiry will also \"establish what, if any, criminal or misconduct offences are apparent\". The Met added: \"There are currently 30 officers progressing the investigation which reflects the serious nature of the allegations and the seriousness with which the MPs view this issue. \"This is a large scale and complex investigation that has grown to incorporate numerous lines of inquiry. The investigation will not be short.\" Cameron told MPs at prime minister's questions in the House of Commons: \"A police officer posing as a member of the public and sending an email potentially to blacken the name of a cabinet minister is a very serious issue and does need to be seriously investigated. \"The Metropolitan police service is conducting a thorough and well-resourced investigation to get to the truth of this matter as quickly as possible. \"The Independent Police Complaints Commission will be supervising the investigation and I think we should allow them to get to the truth.\" Mitchell was offered strong support by Tory MPs as he listened to prime minister's questions standing at the bar of the Commons. Jeremy Hunt, the health secretary, exchanged what appeared to be friendly words with the former chief whip, who wore a bright pink tie. Mitchell stood next to Greg Knight, a former colleague in the whips' office during the Maastricht rebellions in the 1990s. Knight was brought to the whips' office when Mitchell was appointed chief whip in September. David Davis initially sat in his usual place for the session. But after the Tory MP Rob Wilson asked a question about Mitchell the former shadow home secretary went and stood next to Mitchell. Earlier, Davis, who is leading the campaign to overturn what he called a \"gross injustice\" against Mitchell, said the published version of a police log of his confrontation with officers in Downing Street would be \"torn to shreds\" in court. In an escalation of Mitchell's campaign against the police, Davis told the Guardian the police had been called into question by a series of revelations over the past 48 hours. Labour has called for an urgent inquiry into the incident, saying it threatens trust between the police and ministers. Davis, whose 2005 Tory leadership campaign was run by Mitchell, said: • The police log has \"very similar wording\" to two emails sent by a serving officer, who claimed to have witnessed the incident, which were sent to his local MP, John Randall, the deputy chief whip. Randall, who had a strained relationship with Mitchell, handed the emails to No 10 and briefed Mitchell. No 10 says Randall acted properly as a constituency MP. The police officer has now admitted he was not present. • The police log and the email claimed the incident was witnessed by several members of the public. CCTV footage of the incident, broadcast on Channel 4 News on Tuesday night, appears to show that only one member of the public stood outside the gate during the incident. • The police log claimed that Mitchell made his incendiary remarks that police were behaving like \"fucking plebs\" as he wheeled his bike to the side gate after being refused permission to wheel it through the main gate. Davis claims that the CCTV footage, which has no sound and does not show their faces at all times, does not show Mitchell speaking to anyone in this precise period. At the same time Downing Street revealed that the second corroborating email, now known to have been sent from a police officer posing as a member of the public who was not present at the scene, had been dismissed as \"unreliable\" by Sir Jeremy Heywood, the cabinet secretary responsible for investigating the incident in the autumn."

    "content": "M stopped pacing the carpet and looked out through his bullet-proof window. The bleak vista made the head of the Secret Intelligence Service even gloomier. A bitter drizzle was falling on the grey Thames. He buzzed his secretary. \"Miss Moneypenny, any indication when 007 will finally deign to put in an appearance?\" Before she could reply, Bond was standing beside her desk. \"James,\" she gasped. \"The old man is beside himself. Where have you been?\" 007 smoothly responded: \"Signal failure at Cockfosters.\" He brushed at his crumpled jacket. \"Christ, how can people stand the underground? Get on to Q would you? Ask him when the new Aston will be ready.\" \"For you James, anything,\" melted Moneypenny. \"You'd better go straight in. There's a big flap about something.\" Bond greeted this information with a laconic smile. \"What is it this time? Cyber-terrorism? Nuclear blackmail? Biological warfare? Or just your run-of-the-mill megalomaniac with sharks in his swimming pool, an unfeasible space weapon and the same old dream of world domination?\" \"Closer to home, from what I gather,\" responded Moneypenny. \"And much more serious.\" The head of SIS greeted his most valued agent with relief imperfectly disguised by sarcasm. \"How good of you to join us at last, Commander.\" \"And a Merry Christmas to you too, sir,\" quipped Bond. \"I see nothing about this Christmas to merit the description 'Merry'. The reverse, in fact,\" declared M. \"Sit down. I have a very grave matter to share with you.\" M began to explain: \"For some time now, this department has become increasingly concerned that there is a conspiracy against Britain. Consider this last year. Almost every institution that the British once loved or respected has been held up to ridicule or contempt. The police. The church. The BBC. Parliament itself. The banks. I'd say the press as well, but no one ever loved or respected those reptiles. Even we in the intelligence services have been accused of the most foul conduct. It has been a terrible year.\" 007 looked sceptical. \"With respect, sir, I'm not sure I entirely agree. The jubilee was popular. Prince Philip was left out in the rain for a bit too long, but otherwise it passed off without incident. Then there was the Olympics – everyone agrees that was a great success.\" M regarded him coldly. \"I've no doubt that you enjoyed the Olympics. Mr Daniel Boyle further inflated your already enormous ego by giving you a starring part in his opening ceremony with Her Majesty no less as your latest conquest. But for some of us, that charade was just a security nightmare.\" M sighed: \"Frankly, I'm surprised by your naivety, 007. Bread and circuses, that's all it was. Bread and circuses to distract the masses from what is happening to their country. \"Austerity into the indefinite future.Aircraft carriers with no planes. The Americans have practically given up on us.\" M was warming to his theme. \"Isolated in Europe. Berlin Station secured a transcript of Angela Merkel's private remarks about Britain and it does not make for happy reading.\" The head of SIS reached into a desk drawer and pulled out a folder. In red letters, it was emblazoned with the script: \"TOP SECRET: FOR YOUR EYES ONLY\". \"This dossier contains all the information that is currently known about the men we think are responsible.\" 007 remained unconvinced. \"Does it have a name, sir? This conspiracy?\" \"As it happens, 007, yes it does,\" snapped M. \"They call themselves The Coalition.\" M pulled some papers out of the dossier. A photo of a dark-haired man in his 40s was clipped to the top sheet. \"This is the head of the organisation. We've been monitoring him for some time.\" 007 took one look at the picture and laughed. \"It's Dave Cameron! I know him, sir. We were at Oxford together. Remember him being reasonably able at tennis. A tricksy backhand. Didn't seem up to much else. Are you saying he is at the head of a plot to destroy Britain?\" M exploded. \"For God's sake, 007. Take this seriously. He's been prime minister for two and a half years. Have you really not been paying any attention at all?\" Bond shrugged. \"Busy saving the world, sir. I don't watch much news.\" M gave him a hard stare: \"Well, now I need you to concentrate on saving Britain.\" He stabbed a forefinger at the picture: \"If this man is not responsible for the state of the country, who is?\" M pulled out another photo and tossed it across the desk to Bond. \"This is his wife.\" 007 looked at the picture quizzically. \"I don't think it is, sir,\" he said. \"Even I've watched enough news to know that this is Rebekah Brooks, flame-haired former editor of the Sun, sharer of kitchen suppers, horses and other intimacies with Cameron. Now facing trial on multiple charges relating to the phone-hacking scandal.\" M looked again. \"You're right. I'm afraid Miss Moneypenny is not as young as she once was. The filing is in a terrible muddle.\" M pulled out another sheaf of papers. Once again, to the top of the first sheet was attached a picture. It was another man in his 40s, but this time wearing not a blue tie but a yellow one. \"Our sources say this is the number two in the organisation,\" said M. \"Half Dutch. Half Russian. As if that wasn't suspicious enough, married to a Spaniard. Fluent in almost as many languages as you, Commander. All the trademarks of a double-agent.\" Bond appraised the photo. The man was smiling determinedly into the camera, but 007 could detect a deep sadness in his eyes. \"He looks pretty harmless to me, sir.\" \"Yes, yes,\" responded M testily. \"That's the whole point. His yellow faction were supposed to be the moderating influence that kept the blue faction under control. But where's the evidence for that? \"I assigned 006 to infiltrate Clegg's outfit, but before he could report, he was murdered. Poor soul. Stood at a byelection for the Lib Dems. Didn't stand a chance.\" M pulled out another photo.\"This is said to be their top strategist and also the money man. Codename \"the submarine\" because he dives out of sight whenever the proverbial hits the fan. Real name Osborne. Keeps promising the country that things will get better and yet they've just got worse and worse. Classic disinformation tactic.\" Bond nodded. \"Ah, yes, one of the Bullingdon boys. Declined their invitation myself. Didn't see the appeal of dressing up like a footman and throwing bread rolls at each other. What's the word for it? Plebeian.\" M pulled out another picture. It was of a man with unruly blonde hair stuck on a zip wire. \"Who is that clown?\" asked 007. \"Don't be fooled by appearances,\" responded M. \"Clever man. Classical education. Can work a crowd. Throbs with ambition. Deadliest rival of Cameron. Could be a very useful asset for us. But he's not your concern, 007. I have ordered our best female agent to get close to him. He has a weakness for the other gender almost as notorious as your own.\" M pressed his buzzer. \"Miss Moneypenny, please ask the Quartermaster to join us.\" Q came in. \"Now, pay attention, 007. This ordinary-looking pen is standard equipment for all our field agents.\" Bond took the pen, pointed it at the wall and clicked the end, eagerly expecting it to fire an armour-piercing nano-bullet or perhaps shoot a five-second poison dart. To his surprise, all that came out of the end was a dribble of ink. \"You've beaten me, Q. What is this for?\" \"Writing your report, of course,\" replied Q. \"I suppose you were expecting it to be a deadly weapon disguised as a writing instrument. Wrong, 007. I called it an ordinary pen because it is an ordinary pen. Cuts to our budget have left us with no money for all the fancy gadgets you used to enjoy.\" \"We're all in this together,\" murmured M. Bond looked disconsolate. \"Please tell me that the Aston is ready.\" \"More bad news, I'm afraid,\" responded Q. \"Gone are the days when Her Majesty's government could afford to indulge its agents with a top-of-the-range, supercharged sports car replete with machine guns, ejector seat, heat-seeking missiles, leather upholstery and multiple cup holders. On your way out, Miss Moneypenny will show you how to renew your bus and tube pass.\" M broke in: \"Now, listen carefully, 007. Your mission is to penetrate the coalition and discover their intentions. If you are caught, this department will deny all knowledge of your existence. If you are injured, don't expect the disability benefit that was previously customary. Mr Duncan Smith has put an end to that. \"Don't underestimate the enemy. They are not like the adversaries you are accustomed to; they are not like Blofeld or Dr No or Goldfinger who conveniently tell you their masterplan just in time for you to thwart it. Forget that. \"These people are politicians. Treachery is their business. Are they a ruthless conspiracy to ruin Britain? Or are they a bunch of blithering incompetents who have no idea what they are doing? That's what we need to find out. And there isn't much time. That's all, 007. Good luck.\" Bond grimaced. \"I think I'm going to need it, sir.\""

    "title": "Why I'm feeling so crabby about cancer conspiracy theories | Cath Ennis",
    "content": "I remember exactly where I was the very first time I learned that I was part of a global conspiracy, raking in millions of dollars and laughing sadistically as people died all around me: I was at my friends' 2004 Christmas party, and had just told a fellow guest that I was a research scientist and worked at the BC Cancer Agency. The millions of dollars were news to me, given that as a freshly minted PhD I was making C$35,000 (£22,000) a year at the time. However, what really took me aback was the sheer vehemence of the anger being directed at me by my friends' new neighbour. He jabbed his finger at me as he raised his voice and ranted about how \"all you scientists are sitting on a 100% effective cure for cancer\" (\"a bunch of vitamins smushed together with proteins\" were his exact words), watching millions of people die as we counted the royalty money from the \"useless poisons\" we were forcing people to take. The neighbour was ejected from the party, never to be invited back, after poking my husband in the chest when he came to see if I was OK – but I've heard that same conspiracy theory many times since. It crops up most commonly online, to the extent that I read even those news articles about my own institute's latest research findings with a sense of impending doom that worsens as I near the bottom of the page. Now, I'm not an idiot – I know progress is frustratingly slow (but steady), and I know that some big pharma business practices are rather less than optimally ethical. However, having spent 12 of the last 14 years in academic cancer research (first in the lab and then as a research project manager/grant application wrangler), I also understand why the problem is so hard. (Briefly, killing cancer cells while leaving normal cells unharmed is like trying to win an old fashioned infantry battle in which both sides are wearing the same uniform, except some of the enemy have slightly different shaped buttons, others have slightly longer bootlaces, others have slightly lacier underwear, and all have the ability to suddenly change clothes halfway through the fight).\n\nThere is no \"cure\" – just incrementally earlier detection, more effective treatments, and – in some cases, such as the HPV vaccine – better prevention. We have a long way still to go, but things really are much better than they used to be. (If you're interested in learning more, I highly recommend Siddhartha Mukherjee's excellent book 'The Emperor of All Maladies: A Biography of Cancer'). The urge to contribute to further improvements to global cancer outcomes is what drives all the cancer researchers I know to keep going – and that goes for collaborators I've met who work in big pharma company labs just as much as for my colleagues in the academic sector. Many of us got into this field in the first place because a loved one succumbed to cancer (my Grandma, in my case, when I was 15). I know people who've turned their backs on much more lucrative medical careers to focus on research; I myself took a pay cut and switched from a permanent job back to the world of short-term contracts to return to academic cancer research after a couple of unfulfilling years in the biotech industry. Believe me, a lot of people could be making a lot more money doing other things. Sure, there are some pretty big egos in research labs around the world, but they're driven by fame rather than fortune. More importantly, if we really were sitting on a secret cure, no one in this field or any of our loved ones would ever die from cancer, and that just Is. Not. True. In one recent high-profile example, Dr Ralph Steinman died of pancreatic cancer just days before being awarded the 2011 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, despite concerted efforts by himself and colleagues to use his own findings to fight the disease. Closer to home, I know dozens of people in both academic and big pharma cancer research who either have had cancer or who have lost someone close to them to the disease. So. Secret cure? Massive global conspiracy? Sure. We've managed to buy off every single person involved in the clinical trials we had to conduct to prove that this miracle drug is in fact the cure – all the patients, their families and friends, nurses, doctors, medical records transcriptionists, statisticians, graduate students, etc. We keep our chemotherapy drug royalty profits rolling in by refusing to take the cure ourselves when we get cancer, or to give it to any of our friends or family members. We protect our jobs at the expense of millions of deaths because there's nothing else this group of highly trained people could feasibly do, no neglected diseases we could work on, once we admit to the world that cancer is cured. And not one person so far has wanted to claim the Nobel Prize and the love and admiration of the entire world that a \"cure\" would bring them! Wasn't that lucky? Oh, and by the way – big pharma are shutting down that other cure you've heard about – you know, the super cheap Epsom salt one or whatever the Facebook share of the week is – because there's no way their huge teams of experienced intellectual property lawyers could possibly find a way to patent a new and unique way to formulate and use an existing product. But SSSHHHH! Don't tell anyone … Cath Ennis is an expat Brit working as a cancer genomics project manager in Vancouver, Canada. Follow her on Twitter at @enniscath"

    "title": "Met police investigate claim of 'pleb' row conspiracy against Andrew Mitchell",
    "content": "Scotland Yard has said it is considering the possibility there was a conspiracy to fabricate evidence against the former Conservative chief whip Andrew Mitchell, insisting its inquiry would go \"where the evidence takes us\". The Metropolitan police vowed to get to the truth after No 10 told them to get to the bottom of the \"exceptionally serious\" allegation that a serving police officer fabricated evidence that led to Mitchell's resignation in October. Scotland Yard, in a statement issued on Wednesday, said the allegation went \"to the very heart of the public's trust in the police service\". It added: \"If any evidence emerges of conspiracy this will form part of the investigation.\" Mitchell was forced to resign after the police log and an email by an unnamed officer suggested he had called police officers \"fucking plebs\" when they declined to let him wheel his bicycle through the Downing Street gates. He admitted swearing at the police but has strenuously denied the toxic charge that he called them \"plebs\". Newly released CCTV footage appeared to raise questions about some aspects of the police account of the altercation between Mitchell and officers at the gates of Downing Street amid reports that one corroborating witness, the serving police officer, was not even present at the scene. The official police log said \"several members of public [were] present\" during the incident. The footage shows that only one member of the public appeared to take an interest in the unfolding event. Other pedestrians were seen walking past. The film has no sound, the police involved have had their identities disguised and it is not possible to see Mitchell's face during the moments the comments are said to have been made. In an extraordinary twist to the story, which No 10 sources insisted was entirely coincidental, the police officer – the \"witness\" – emailed his account of the incident to his local MP, John Randall, who was then Mitchell's deputy in the whips' office. Channel 4 said the police officer was also one of Randall's constituents. Sources suggested that Randall, who had a strained relationship with Mitchell when he was appointed as his boss in September, had acted properly as an MP when he forwarded the email to No 10. In its statement, Scotland Yard stated: \"The Metropolitan police service is conducting a thorough and well-resourced investigation to get to the truth of the matter as quickly as possible. \"Since receiving fresh information last Thursday, the MPS has acted swiftly. On Saturday, an investigation into the alleged unauthorised disclosure of information was reopened. On Saturday evening, an officer was arrested on suspicion of misconduct in public office. \"On Sunday, the investigation was referred to the IPCC for supervision. The investigation is looking at the alleged unauthorised disclosure of information and the circumstances surrounding a police officer's claim to have witnessed an incident in Downing Street. If any evidence emerges of conspiracy this will form part of the investigation. \"This is a fast-moving and comprehensive investigation and the highly unusual events of the last three days have shown this inquiry will need to go where the evidence takes us as it progresses.\" The former shadow home secretary David Davis said he had seen emails that clearly showed a police officer had \"masqueraded\" as a civilian and acted in a way that \"effectively completely undermined\" Mitchell in the eyes of the prime minister, who then had to decide what to do. He told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme: \"That explains quite a lot of the, frankly what appears to be, with hindsight, daft decisions, in terms of the way they handled the whole issue.\" Davis criticised the cabinet secretary, Jeremy Heywood, for failing to check who had sent the email. \"Bear in mind there was a cabinet secretary who investigated this and clearly did not check who the individual who sent the email was, given that he gave his own name, though we can't use his name. None of this, whether it's the Met investigation or Jeremy Heywood, none of it's exactly Sherlock Holmes. \"I think all investigations did not go to the heart of it. Look at the CCTV footage, see whether it's consistent with the allegations, what's been said – you can't draw conclusions from it, because it's very low resolution, but it clearly wasn't.\" He said the Met chief, Bernard Hogan-Howe, needed to ask whether the motive for the officer's actions was money, politics or \"trying to help out some friends\". Davis said: \"How did he get the information that propped it up? [The email is] virtually identical [to the log]. Did he collude with anybody else, was he in communication with the original officer?\" On Mitchell's future, Davis added: \"He was forced to go by a combination of events, which started with Downing Street's reaction as a result of the email. As a result we've had a serious injustice. He should be returned to high office. He was a fantastic international development secretary. He probably will not become chief whip again but I think the injustice should be put right.\" The Police Federation said the arrest of a serving police officer and the ongoing inquiry was a \"separate issue to the original claims made by the Metropolitan police officers as to their treatment by a serving MP\". The federation suggested a full investigation of the incident should have taken place at the time it emerged in September. \"It is disappointing that all information and evidence regarding the original incident was not revealed at the time – if that had occurred perhaps we would not be in the situation we now find ourselves in as a police service,\" the federation said in a statement."

    "title": "Rightwingers seek tweet revenge with claims of unemployment conspiracy",
    "content": "The unemployment rate has fallen below 8%! For the first time since January 2009! Surely time for Americans everywhere to come together and celebrate the fact that more people in the US have jobs? No. Not at all. Instead, conservatives are furious. According to some, the only way the unemployment rate can possibly have fallen is through manipulation and scheming – most likely by shadowy, Chicago-based figures. (For which, read \"the Obama campaign\".) Here are some of the people who do not like falling unemployment. At least, not under a Democratic president, a month out from an election. Jack Welch Welch, former chief executive of General Electric, now describes himself as \"Author, commentator, founder of the Jack Welch Management Institute.\" He could add \"snark\": Unbelievable jobs numbers..these Chicago guys will do anything..can't debate so change numbers — Jack Welch (@jack_welch) October 5, 2012 Welch attracted support from the Republican congressman Allen West: In regards to today's Jobs report---I agree with former GE CEO Jack Welch, Chicago style politics is at work here...tinyurl.com/9rbommz — Allen West (@AllenWest) October 5, 2012 To be fair to Welch, he was out there trolling the unemployment figures before it became mainstream to do so. @dmacd11 at 7.9 it would be Chicago and labor Sec in action — Jack Welch (@jack_welch) October 5, 2012 On Thursday night, he was already predicting skullduggery, tweeting to a man called Don MacDonald that if the jobs numbers were at 7.9% he would deem it was \"Chicago and labor Sec in action\". Joe Scarborough The irascible host of Morning Joe on MSNBC repeatedly questioned the methodology on Friday's show. He repeatedly said the 7.8% figure \"did not make sense and was \"confusing\". CNN's rival show, Starting Point with Soledad O'Brien, featured a more analytical discussion with Ken Rogoff, a Harvard professor and former IMF chief economist, who was also sceptical – but on the more factual basis that unemployment remained high and the economy sluggish. But Scarborough, a former Republican congressman, returned to the methodology repeatedly in the final half-hour of the show. Expect liberal-leaning MSNBC to shift the tone of its coverage somewhat during the day. Conn Carroll I don't think BLS cooked numbers. I think a bunch of Dems lied about getting jobs. That would have same effect. — Conn Carroll (@conncarroll) October 5, 2012 Conn Carroll, senior writer at the Washington Examiner, does not think the US Bureau of Labor Statistics manipulated the figures. Let's be reasonable here. It was just a load of Democrats lying. Keith Urbahn No, there's nothing at all curious about the last jobs report diving to 7.8% unemployment before the election. — Keith Urbahn (@keithurbahn) October 5, 2012 Urbahn is Donald Rumsfeld's former chief of staff. Until he joined the BLS conspiracy, his most famous tweet was about Osama Bin Laden being dead. He was one of the first to pump out the news on 1 May. Ross from the Tea Party So the unemployment rate is 7.8%. Well Rush was right, the Obama Admin did manipulate the numbers to get it under 8% b4 the election. #tcot — Ross . (@indyrallen) October 5, 2012 If that's Rush Limbaugh that Ross is referring to, then perhaps we shouldn't be too surprised. Couple this with the fact a later tweet has the Tea Party hashtag and I think we can safely conclude where Ross is coming from. The unemployment numbers WILL BE CORRECTED to reflect the actual rate...after Mitt takes the oath of office. #tcot #teaparty — Ross . (@indyrallen) October 5, 2012 Voices of reason Not all conservatives followed Welch down the road to fairyland, however. Tony Fratto, a former Bush White House aide, pointed out that for the Bureau of Labor Statistics to be caught cooking the books would be a huge scandal: BLS is not manipulating data. Evidence of such would be a scandal of enormous proportions & loss of credibility. — Tony Fratto (@TonyFratto) October 5, 2012 Philip Klein, a senior editorial writer on the Washington Examiner, agreed. BLS is comprised of career professionals. Don't see how anybody could argue it's manipulated by WH without hard evidence. — Philip Klein (@philipaklein) October 5, 2012"

    "title": "A conspiracy of silence allowed sexual harassment to stay routine | Rachel Cooke",
    "content": "When the BBC's director general, George Entwistle, appeared in front of the culture select committee last week, one of the MPs who grilled him asked if he would agree that, with hindsight, the decision to pull the Newsnight investigation into Jimmy Savile had been a \"catastrophic\" mistake. I was taken aback by this. Even allowing for the schadenfreude you see rolling off MPs in select committee mode – it rises stinkily, like some awful Victorian miasma – his question seemed over the top. A famine is a catastrophe. Or a war. But the failure of BBC management to green light a segment of a late-night news programme? That's an error, not a catastrophe. Such exaggeration is all of a piece with the fury now directed at the BBC in general and Entwistle in particular: a collective rage that is not synthetic, exactly, but so disproportionately intense as to have taken on a weird life of its own. One understands the need for a lightning rod in this kind of situation, for one individual or institution to take a battering on behalf of the many. This is how displaced anger works. But there have also been days when I've wondered if anyone still remembers what we're talking about here. Jimmy Savile abused children for 40 years. The police believe that he may have had 300 victims. No internal inquiry in the world is going to change that. Perhaps, though, the distraction is necessary. Our outrage, in truth, has little to do with any institution, however remiss. It's born of bewilderment that something so terrible could be in plain sight. Why, we wonder, did we not notice? Yet even this idea, if you unpick it, is kind of phoney. I'm not saying that I didn't feel it myself, at first: the ground shifting, metaphorically speaking, beneath my feet. Over and over, I asked friends why the conspiracy of silence had been so absolute and no one was able to give me a satisfactory explanation. But then I started thinking about my life – I am 43 – and I realised I could answer the question myself. I am privileged. I have never been abused or raped; my parents loved me; I did well at school; I'm someone who can stand up for myself. And yet my life has never not been punctuated by sexual harassment. When did it begin? I was 13. Two boys took against me. They didn't like my face, my voice or my clothes and they enjoyed reminding me of this at the end of every school day. The challenge was to grab my nascent breasts and to twist them, hard. Also to lift my skirt. I was very scared of them. But did I tell anyone? No. I simply took a longer route home and ran all the way. Well, that was my induction. Things grew calmer once the boys started trying to get laid, but an atmosphere of low-level sexual intimidation nevertheless prevailed. Girls were \"slags\" and their bodies, for all that boys longed to invade them, were both ludicrous (\"look at the tits on her!\") and repulsive (female genitals, as depicted on various walls in black magic marker, resembled nothing so much as some form of mutant wildlife, swollen and scary and covered with poisonous bristles). If, god forbid, a tampon fell out of your bag, all hell would break loose. Menstruation really was a curse, in that sense. I was pretty Zen, by this point. Battle-hardened. Also, I sincerely believed that I had only to survive school to enter into a civilised world in which men in black polo necks would talk to me about books and art and love. Wrong! At university, I was one of a group of women who wanted our college to have a code on sexual harassment (I'd thought carefully about this, being the child of a tutor-student relationship myself). The opposition we encountered was extraordinarily personal, as if we'd called for the mass castration of all males, and the men were merely returning fire. Later, I suggested it might be a good idea not to spend common room funds on the Sun and to close down a dining society whose name aggressively celebrated the chasing of women. The abuse I got had to be heard to be believed. I was frigid, a lesbian, sanctimonious, stupid, ugly and in need of a good shag. In the vacation, I worked in a pub. One of the regulars ran a book on whether I wore stockings or tights. I told him – to shut him up – that I wore tights. But this was not good enough. Whenever I leant over, he would reach for my thighs. He and his cronies would then laugh and jeer. When Christmas arrived, they demanded kisses much as they would request a pint. Groping was standard. I did not complain. I wanted to keep my job. But perhaps my disapproval showed on my face, for I was soon punished all the same. The landlord said the till was down; he would take the missing money from my wages. This went on for days: him robbing me, me trying to smile and the regulars enjoying my discomfort. I could go on. The man who locked me inside his car, the better to try and have his way with me. The man who shoved me outside his flat at two in the morning, having suddenly tired of me. The man who chased me up the street as I walked home from the tube and then coolly waited at the other side of a hedge while I sobbed and desperately rang a stranger's doorbell. The man who tried to break into my hotel room when I was working on a story. The man who shouted lewd comments at me while I ate alone in a Philadelphia bar. In Philadelphia, older and wiser, I spoke to the management, with the result that I was moved (it would have been better if they'd moved him, but I was grateful anyway). In every other case, though, I would no more have thought to complain than I would have run through town naked. The plain fact is that this stuff was so unremarkable as to be unworthy of comment, let alone fuss. And even when it was remarkable, when I would have been within my rights to call the police, I kept quiet. Easy to shake your fist at the sky; much harder to shake it in a man's face. And this, surely, is why there is so much heat in the Savile debate. We are, at least in part, angry with ourselves. Fear, stoicism, an ability to close bad memories off; these are the things that got me and countless other women through, down the years. But our acquiescence had serious consequences – catastrophic, in fact – for the less well-defended among us. The atmosphere worked in Savile's favour and that of others like him. And perhaps it still does. Even as I write, I'm aware that some of this column – perhaps all of it – will be met with derision and, in some quarters, with outright disbelief."

    "title": "Owen Paterson's climate change problem: cock-up or conspiracy? | Damian Carrington",
    "content": "This is getting silly. The new environment secretary Owen Paterson has been widely accused of being a climate change sceptic, a serious charge for the holder of his post in a government pledged by David Cameron to be the \"greenest ever\". The accusation may be a false one and if so it would be very easy to dismiss. So the Guardian asked the environment department's press office: \"What is the secretary of state's view on climate change? Will he deny he's a climate change sceptic?\" It took a long time to get a reply, but here it is, in full. A spokesperson said: Defra is responsible for a range of issues affecting the environment and the rural economy. One of these issues is the impact of climate change and the Secretary of State is committed to exploring and developing the response required by Government, business and communities. You don't need to be a £1000-an-hour lawyer to realise that's not a straight answer. So why didn't we get a straight answer? As ever, the answer must be cock-up or conspiracy. The cock-up theory is somewhat undermined by the statement issued by another new minister accused of lacking green credentials. John Hayes, the new energy minister, has publicly opposed wind farms but quickly put out a statement - in his own name - saying: I am proud to assume the role of energy minister at such a crucial time both for our energy security and for tackling climate change. We face a major challenge to keep the lights on in the most cost-effective way. In achieving this, we must not be over-reliant on any one technology, but build a balanced low carbon mix and make the best use of Britain's domestic energy resources and skilled workforce. It seems new ministers can make pretty clear statements quickly if they want to, which leaves us with a troubling situation. Paterson is on the record as describing wind farms as \"clearly a massive waste of consumers' money\" and apparently asked the cabinet to \"end of all energy subsidies and fast-track the exploitation of shale gas\". On the other hand, he has referred in passing at least to climate change as one of the \"long-term challenges\" faced by the UK and he has nowhere questioned the science of climate change, to my knowledge. So which is it? When even the sober FT is calling Paterson a \"known climate sceptic\", you have a problem that needs solving. The longer you don't, the worse it gets (unless of course the aim is to please climate sceptics). If all of this nonsense is a cock-up, then it is a shambles. If not, then David Cameron has placed a climate sceptic at the head of the environment department in order to seriously hamper the sensible green policies the public has repeatedly said it wants. To place the fringe views of some in the Conservative party above the needs of the nation in this way may be seen in time as one of the most stunningly cynical moves ever made by a prime minister. Only an unequivocal statement from Paterson will show us which of these is correct."

In an interview to be published in the Observer on Sunday, singer Matt Bellamy discusses Fox News presenter Glenn Beck's embrace of their 2009 album The Resistance and the use of their hit single Uprising in rightwing conspiracy videos on YouTube. \"In the US the conspiracy theory subculture has been hijacked by the right to try to take down people like Obama and put forward rightwing libertarianism,\" Bellamy said. Defining himself as \"a left-leaning libertarian – more in the realm of Noam Chomsky,\" he added: \"Uprising was requested by so many politicians in America for use in their rallies and we turned them down on a regular basis.\" Bellamy added that when writing lyrics, his motives are more therapeutic than polemical. \"When I dabble in watching the news and reading about current events I tend to get a future negative view and that's something I've dealt with through music,\" he said. \"It's quite possible I'm slightly paranoid. But I'd say making music is an expression of feelings of helplessness and lack of control that I think a lot of people can relate to.\" Conservative pundit Beck is a long-standing fan of the Devon band, despite their labelling him previously as \"a crazy rightwinger\". Muse's new album The 2nd Law is released on Monday."

    "title": "Manchester shootings: was there a 'criminal conspiracy' to shelter suspect?",
    "content": "A major plank of the police inquiry into the fatal shooting of two unarmed officers is whether there was a \"criminal conspiracy\" that helped the suspect in the killings remain hidden for five weeks. Greater Manchester police are determined to bring to justice anyone who played any part in helping to shelter the suspect in the police killings. Despite a £50,000 reward and 50 armed raids across Greater Manchester, including on the Hattersley estate, a five-week hunt for Dale Cregan – a suspect in the murder of a father and son – failed to apprehend him. Instead on Tuesday morning the two female police officers, Nicola Hughes and Fiona Bone, were sent to part of the estate, unarmed and without back-up, to respond to a burglary report, where they were killed in a gun and grenade attack. The chief constable of the Greater Manchester force, Peter Fahy, made clear on Tuesday that there was no intelligence on the address in Abbey Gardens where the officers met their deaths that might have indicated the need for an armed presence. Hours after the officers were fatally shot, Cregan, 29, handed himself in and was being questioned on Wednesday on suspicion of the murder of the officers and the killings of David and Mark Short, a father and son. The Guardian understands the two individuals who lived in the house in Abbey Gardens are not being treated as suspects. Police have spoken to them but they have not been arrested and are unlikely to be. Instead it is understood the pair, a 33-year-old man and his girlfriend, might have been held against their will inside the house before a call was made to which PCs Bone and Hughes responded. A measure of the gulf the police might have to cross in their investigation emerged on Wednesday. Youths in Hattersley were heard laughing and shouting: \"Pop, pop\", and on Facebook a \"Dale Cregan for OBE\" page received several anti-police comments before being taken down. The search for Cregan began five weeks ago and was one of the biggest manhunts in the history of the Greater Manchester force. He had been questioned in June over the murder of Mark Short, 23, who was gunned down in the early hours of the morning on 25 May in the Cotton Tree pub in Droylsden. Cregan was released on bail after questioning pending further investigation. Two months later Short's father, David, was killed at his home in Clayton, Manchester – a mile away from the Cotton Tree – in a grenade and gun attack, sparking the manhunt. Police offered the £50,000 reward – hoping it would be a life-changing amount to entice individuals to talk – and carried out more than 100 raids across Greater Manchester, including 50 with armed officers, during the operation. There were reports from the estate on Tuesday that while this was going on Cregan was regularly seen drinking in pubs. But these reports could not be verified. A police source dismissed one report that he held a goodbye party in a pub on Monday night. One retired senior officer said the issue of individuals on the estate apparently claiming to have seen the fugitive being hunted had to be treated carefully. \"How good is the information that he was seen drinking in pubs?\" he asked. He said there was no doubt that the manhunt had been intensive and active. \"They will have had intensive coverage of the suspect,\" he said. \"They will have used surveillance, looked at his phones, used informants and done all sorts of things including using the reward to draw people out. \"What is certain is that the police were hunting him; they weren't sitting about saying let's just wait until he turns up. They were actively looking for him. But if someone in the community has a network that is willing to make him disappear often it's quite hard to find the individual.\" Journalist Carl Fellstrom, the author of Hoods, the story of the Nottingham-based organised crime family the Gunns, said behind any wall of silence was fear and a failure of trust between the police and the community. \"It is a double-edged thing,\" he said. \"People are not only fearful, they also don't trust the police with the information. They are not perceived to be part of the community.\""

    "content": "PARANOIA, PARANOIA, EVERYBODY'S COMING TO GET US The fact that lots of football fans are paranoid doesn't mean everybody's not out to get them. It's a state of affairs that may explain why a disturbing number of tinfoil turban-wearing Liverpool fans have been busily scanning their houses for listening devices, taping polythene over their windows and expounding delusional conspiracy theories in the build-up to their club's big match against Manchester United at Anfield. If these dingbats are to be believed, it seems the notoriously anti-scouse media are once again attempting to undermine this once great institution's attempts to defeat their bitter rivals. You see, this week assorted media outlets reported the controversial news that Liverpool chief executive Ian Ayre had announced his awesome dream that the club may one day greedily scupper smaller Premier League teams in a TV deal. The timing of this reportage was immediately seized upon by Liverpool fans of a certain mental \"disposition\" as proof positive that 'bitter' reporters were trying to unsettle their team ahead of one of the biggest games of their season. \"But that's what they want you to think,\" they hissed at less sentient counterparts foolish enough to suggest the sports news reporters in question may just have been reporting sports news. Yesterday, Big Website, a platform the Fiver has long been proud to call a junior digital affiliate, went out of its way to further undermine Liverpool by publishing the first of a two-part interview with John W Henry conducted in Boston by proper journalism's David Conn. \"Very MISLEADING article hurled at LFC right before a major clash with United,\" wrote one reader below the line, taking care to type his missive at 6.12am, when it was less likely They would be monitoring his correspondence. \"The article is boring and could easily be written without a trip to Boston or even an interview for that matter,\" wrote another, sadly neglecting to explain how he would have conducted a two-part interview with John W Henry without actually talking to John W Henry [commission Johann Hari? - Fiver Ed]. In an excerpt from part two of the interview, Conn subtly sets about destroying the confidence of assorted Liverpool players ahead of their weekend match by cleverly phrasing his questions in such a way that Henry had no choice but admit he might have overspent on them. \"Choosing players in any sport is an imperfect science,\" he mused. \"We certainly have been guilty of overspending on some players, and that can be tied to an analytical approach that hasn't worked well enough.\" Using subtle Jedi mind tricks, our man Obi Wan Conn-obi went on to trick Henry into admitting that he hadn't wanted to hire Kenny Dalglish as Liverpool manager. \"I wasn't convinced when we arrived that Kenny should be back managing and I wanted things to work with the manager we inherited,\" said Henry, oblivious to the fact that he was playing right into Manchester United's hands.

Despite the threat of a record £1.5m fine and further four-week suspension hanging over him, Carlos Tevez is expected to put his brass neck on the line and vehemently fight allegations that he refused to play against Bayern Munich in Big Cup – and demand an apology from Roberto Mancini for good measure.

There was another person there… It was a put-up job… It was the CIA… Berlusconi... Conspiracy theories are always enticing: one I was involved with in the 50s was about Mayerling, the 19th-century Austrian scandal involving a prince's lover who died in dodgy circumstances in a hunting lodge. As a new and clueless publisher's reader I was offered a book insisting she'd died in tragically glamorous circumstances (and not, as later came to be accepted, of a botched abortion), and all the prince's friends had been sworn to secrecy. I was greatly taken by this until I showed it to an Austrian-refugee historian who said that some of it might possibly be true, but the one thing that absolutely couldn't be was all these noble Austrians actually keeping a secret: no way. Equally, I suspect, we will never be certain what happened in Perugia; but you can bet the conspiracy theories will unwind like golden skeins in the sky – well, maybe Sky – for years. Such theories are far too good to be destroyed by any mere certainty of fact. Look at the whole Litvinenko business and all the speculation about who spiked his drink; one shrewd journalist I know is certain he was snuffed by MI6… so it continues."

    "title": "Decoding the feline conspiracy | Paul MacInnes",
    "content": "If there were a way, any way, of capturing the energy spent looking at cats on the internet and turning that energy into petrol, I'll tell you what, there'd be at least 20p off a litre of unleaded. Watching cat videos is the yin to the massive wobbling yang of porn and as such is something to be encouraged. Here's the question though: what do the cats get out of it? The truth is that nobody knows, and those who might – the women who dedicate their lives to studying feline habits by letting dozens of them live in their house – usually turn up dead in a pile of furballs and unopened newspapers before anyone can question them. But the issue of quite who cats are and what they want will not go away. It was brought into focus once again this week when a pet, who had disappeared mysteriously five years ago, reappeared equally mysteriously in a completely different part of the US. You know that bit in Seven where Kevin Spacey just appears in that cop shop? Well it was like that. But with fleas. The cat, known to humans as Willow, disappeared in Boulder, Colorado in 2006 and reappeared on the streets of Manhattan two days ago. Delivered by a passerby to a cat shelter, Willow has now been returned to its owners thanks to a microchip found in its neck. Clearly overcome with emotion, one of the owners, a Jamie Squires, said: \"If I could, I would microchip my children.\" That's the spirit. Anyway, Willow disappeared for five years and nobody knows what happened. Not only that, they'll never know, because the cat would never tell. If it were just an isolated example, this may not even have been a matter for concern. But isolated it is not. Remember Geoffrey? He was a Bengal cat with fur the colour of a cheap tiger who, in 2009, disappeared from the Isle of Wight, only to reappear in Whitby three weeks later. \"The only explanation,\" wrote the Telegraph at the time, \"is that [Geoffrey] must have hopped into the luggage compartment of one of the many coaches that pull up at nearby hotels.\" Yeah, that'll be it. Then there's Grant, a cat who popped up in the Netherlands hiding in a shipping container like so much contraband. Investigations concluded that Grant had originated from Scotland, but precisely where no one could say. These are just the cats who turn up. Thousands more vanish each year and if I were Sarah Lund in The Killing I'd be marking all these sightings on a board and plotting a pattern. And that pattern, if my suspicions are correct, would probably end up spelling a word, like \"danger\" or \"revolution!\" or \"salmon terrine!\". Because while most internet cat fans are in it for the lolz and the cute overload, I remain detached, dispassionate, observing coldly. These cats are up to something. In whose interests is it to anthropomorphise cats? Who benefits? (If this were dogs we were talking about, you could use the Latin, cui bonio?) Humans? Maybe, but the gratification is momentary and not unlike that associated with the massive yang we were talking about. The real winner from prevalent anthropomorphism is the anthropomorphised. Not only because in bestowing them with human characteristics we do the dodgy beasts a bit of a favour, but because by wishing cats into being like us, we stop asking what they really are themselves. My theory, obviously, is that they're a breed of bewhiskered evildoers, with sleeper agents all over the place (and don't tell me you haven't seen a cat asleep!) They're everywhere, just waiting for the right moment to pounce on humanity, thrash it about a bit, and leave its corpse as a present for God. I may, I admit, be wrong. But I'd rather be sceptical and alive than doing a cute face and dead. Mr Squires, if he has any sense, will forget about chipping his children and fit Willow with a Catcam instead. In his own time, he'll be able scrutinise the beast's every move just to be sure. And once he's done he could upload the best bits to YouTube."

    "content": "Former vice-president of Fifa Jack Warner is like a V1 rocket, he does the most damage when he falls silent. So it was a relief to us all this week when the Trinidadian announced that his recent tumble from grace was the result of a Zionist conspiracy. Nobody likes a sinister cabal hellbent on world domination, but when it comes to Zionists you have to admire their stamina, don't you? What a great little engine they have. They buzz about disaster like Richie McCaw around the base of a ruck, and just about as illegally too. One minute they are weaving a fabulous conspiracy to bring the West into all-out conflict with Islam, the next springing a banking crisis in the Eurozone, and in between times they still have the Beckham-esque work ethic to derail the career of probably the most important man in Trinidadian football after Dwight Yorke. What next, I wonder: engineering an unexplained coal-scuttle-related accident that leaves Crook Town striker Kevin Devine an injury doubt for tomorrow's Skilltraining Ltd Northern League Division Two clash with Jarrow Roofing? No word of Zionist involvement in the strange affair of Carlos Tevez, but there is an appeal pending, so let's not include anything out just yet. Mind you, any conspiracy would surely already have been uncovered by the hardworking men and women of Manchester City's crack internal investigations unit. No sooner had this determined crew tracked down and cuffed notorious information superhighwayman Garry Cook, than they were set to work on the Munich business. As you might expect, it did not take the investigators more than a couple of weeks to reach the conclusion that \"something had gone on\", and they then launched themselves into finding out exactly what that \"something\" was with all the relish of Joey Barton spotting a glass house as yet unstoned. The vigour of City's detectives could not fail to stir up memories of the glory years of the Football Association's famed compliance unit, known to the innocent and the guilty alike as \"The Unfathomables\". Older readers will recall that the FA sleuths proceeded extremely slowly until they had conclusive proof that the person responsible for any misdeed had already died of old age, upon which they banned them from the game for three years (reduced to six weeks on appeal). By such means the FA ruthlessly stamped out all corruption and venality in the English game, leaving the sort of stain-free environment where even unworldly Russian oligarchs can prosper. What went on with Tevez in Munich is a private matter between lawyers, though sources close to an insider have revealed to me that City discovered that the Argentinian's refusal to come on as a substitute may have been because his legs don't belong to him any more. \"Nobody has ever been entirely certain what goes on with Carlos's body parts contractually,\" Martin Clause, a specialist sports lawyer, explained to me this week, \"but what we are hearing now is that certainly his right leg and probably his left peg from the knee down belong to a consortium registered in the Cayman Islands, with subsidiary rights in cartilage and ligaments owned by a big man in a John Richmond suit who lives in Miami.\" According to an insider who was close to the source of the previous insider's source, Tevez has been renting his limbs back on a \"pay-as-you-go\" basis, but failed to buy a top-up from the leasing company before leaving for Germany. With the use of legs in Europe subject to increased tariffs, the striker ran out of credit while walking to the dugout in the Allianz Arena and would only have been able to get on to the field by slithering on his belly as does the vile and lowly serpent, an action he was unwilling to take because of the humiliation and the possibility of getting grass burns on his tummy. Asked to comment, Tevez's alleged representative, the international business cherub, Kia Ora (He's too orangey for crows, he's just for me and my dog) told Football's World Domination Conference: \"This is purely my opinion, but it's my view that, if you're asking me, the answer you will get back will be something I've possibly made up by myself, in all likelihood, based on what I personally have heard, know or guess, but as I say that's just one person's view, ie my own.\" Other observers believe that Tevez may have been the latest victim of an all too common occurrence in modern football – misquoting himself. This is a form of self-harming known to doctors as Ravanelli's syndrome. Ever since the FA fired England manager Glenn Hoddle for saying them things he never said, except for when he said them (twice), the problem of top football folk deliberately twisting their own words in order to stitch themselves up has become more and more prevalent. The new media have only made things worse. Fernando Torres is believed to be considering taking out a self-gagging order over comments he made on his own website, and it is surely only a matter of days before a player claims to have been \"set up\" by himself on Twitter. Does this all stem, as some psychologists believe, from the fact that for many sportsmen and women the public persona, the performer, gradually becomes a separate other distinct from the private person? In such cases, it is said, Carlos Tevez and \"Carlos Tevez\" exist as entities entirely apart from one another, allowing Carlos Tevez to quite sincerely and truthfully deny saying words that \"Carlos Tevez\" has been taped uttering. Might this be what went on? Or is it, as other experts, posited, simply that a few top players are a bit thick? Or is that just what \"They\" want us to think?"

    "content": "The twin towers were destroyed by controlled explosion Truthers say video footage of the buildings falling points to demolition due to the way the towers bend before collapsing. Also, there appear to be explosions as the windows blow out, floor by floor, from the top downwards. One US academic claims to have tested samples from the wrecked towers which show the presence of chemical residue, suggesting explosives had been used. But in controlled explosion demolition experts collapse a building from the bottom not the top. Experts say the windows were blown out as each floor collapsed on to the one below, sending debris and office equipment flying out. It would also have taken considerable work, which would not have gone unnoticed, to plant sufficient explosives the length of the buildings to bring them down. The Pentagon was hit by a missile, not a plane The evidence for this, say sceptics, is that the major damage to the building comprised a roundish blast hole, not the more extended destruction some say would be caused by aeroplane wings. Truthers claim parts of a scrapped plane, including the tail, were moved to the Pentagon as part of the fabrication. This theory ignores the considerable evidence of the bodies of passengers and crew at the site which were photographed. Thousands of people saw the plane circle then fly into the Pentagon. Some quickly photographed the scene. Anyone planting plane debris at the site afterwards would surely have been seen. World Trade Centre building 7, adjacent to the twin towers, must have been was destroyed by controlled demolition because it was not hit by a plane This theory is partly based on a remark by the owner of the building who, fearing it was about to collapse, said firefighters inside should be brought out immediately. He used the words: \"Pull it\". This remark has been interpreted as slang for demolishing the building. In fact, the collapse was caused by intense fires in one of the neighbouring twin towers that spread to WTC 7, causing its steel beams to buckle and the building to come down. The hijacked planes were packed with explosives and flown by remote control Some conspiracy theorists believe the passengers supposedly on board were either killed elsewhere and their bodies dumped at sea, or were part of the conspiracy and are now in hiding with new identities. A key piece of evidence claimed for this theory is that the mobile phone calls the victims are recorded as having made to loved ones from the doomed planes were not possible because of the altitude of the aircraft and therefore faked using \"voice morphing technology\". However, phone records show the calls were made from satellite phones fitted to the back of the aircraft seats. Israel was behind the attacks in order to draw America into a conflict with Arab nations The evidence claimed for this theory is that 4,000 Jews who supposedly worked at the WTC failed to report for work on 11 September because they had been forewarned by the Israeli intelligence service, Mossad. However, the figure appears to be based on a statement made by the Israeli foreign minister that about 4,000 Israelis were in the cities under attack at the time. More than one in ten of those who died on 9/11 were Jewish. The fourth plane, apparently headed for the White House, was shot down by a missile An order had gone out from President Bush for the flight to be shot down if necessary, but before this could be carried out passengers attempted to charge the hijackers, who flew the plane into the ground in Pennsylvania. There was insider trading in the stocks of the two airlines whose planes were hijacked, United and American, suggesting powerful people knew the attacks were coming The trading has been tracked to other causes."

    "title": "Out, dam'd conspiracy! Shakespeare was no fraud",
    "content": "However much we may claim to be curious about hat really happened in history, it seems we often prefer our stories about the past to follow the pattern of fairytales. Shakespeare understood this very well. He gave his audiences Richard III, the hunchbacked wicked uncle, rightfully destroyed by the good avenging prince, for instance, rather than the complex politician of history, defeated and killed by an invading opportunist. History may provide good raw material for drama, but it will need a bit of underlying myth if it is really going to stay in the imagination. To that extent, the film Anonymous – which offers a version of Elizabethan history obsessed with monarchy, parenthood and usurpation, in which the rightful heir to the English throne is wickedly kept from his inheritance – is only doing what costume drama has done since Shakespeare's time, acting out our fantasies in fancy dress while mentioning a few real events and actual people. But Shakespeare never went so far as to claim that there was no real Richard III, only a pretender using a pseudonym. Nor did he suggest that 1485 was a year of complete peace, during which the traces of the Battle of Bosworth were cynically faked by the establishment. The plot of Anonymous, by comparison, is based on the premise that Shakespeare wasn't Shakespeare. It isn't just a piece of sexed-up historical drama in the great Elizabethan tradition: it belongs to a much more recent mindset, that of the great Victorian conspiracy theories. I say Victorian because nobody doubted that Shakespeare had written his own plays until the 1850s. The first claim to the contrary is Delia Bacon's article William Shakespeare and his Plays; an Inquiry Concerning Them, printed in Putnam's Magazine (in 1856). Bacon thought the Complete Plays represented a deliberate attempt to spread enlightenment, modernity and progress, and that rather than being the work of a single supremely talented showbusiness professional they must have been written by an occult committee of world-designing philosophers. Its leader, she hinted, could only have been Sir Francis Bacon, who had somehow scheduled its meetings in between his other duties as attorney general and his efforts to invent empirical science. Delia Bacon died in an asylum after failing to find a single piece of evidence in favour of her claim, but her example has not inhibited successive waves of other champions, who have credited the plays to Francis Bacon alone, to Christopher Marlowe, to the Fifth Earl of Rutland, to the Sixth Earl of Derby, to the 17th Earl of Oxford, and even to Queen Elizabeth I, among many others. The obvious truth that Shakespeare wrote Shakespeare, sadly, is not news, and popular journalism since the 1850s has preferred news at all costs. Shakespearean scholars, when they have managed to calm themselves, have sometimes paid reluctant tribute to the sheer determination and ingenuity which \"anti-Stratfordian\" writers have displayed, since any theory suggesting that the theatre professional William Shakespeare did not write the Shakespeare canon somehow has to explain why so many of his contemporaries said that he did, and why none of the rest ever said that he did not. Most observers, however, have been more impressed by the anti-Stratfordians' dogged immunity to documentary evidence, not only that which confirms that Shakespeare wrote his own plays, but that which establishes that several of the alternative candidates, including Oxford, were long dead before he had finished doing so. How did this weird cult belief that Shakespeare was a fraud ever come into being? By Delia Bacon's time, the authorship controversy was an accident waiting to happen. In the age of Romanticism, such transcendent, quasi-religious claims were being made for the supreme poetic triumph of the Complete Works that it was becoming well-nigh impossible to imagine how any mere human being could have written them at all. At the same time, the popular understanding of what levels of literacy might have been achieved in 16th-century Stratford was still heavily influenced by a patriotic tradition of Shakespeare-worship which liked to depict the playwright as an uninstructed son of the Warwickshire soil, a thoroughly native genius who had out-written the world without any help from foreign or classical literary models. These two notions combined to persuade Delia Bacon and her more snobbish successors that the Folio's title page and preliminaries could only be part of an elaborate charade, orchestrated by some more elevated personage. They accordingly misread the distinctive literary traces of Shakespeare's solid Elizabethan grammar-school education visible throughout the volume as evidence that the \"real\" author had attended Oxford or Cambridge. This misapprehension was reinforced by the 19th century's deepening sense that there was an absolute boundary between poetry (a disinterested manifestation of high culture) and live theatre (a mercenary form of vulgar entertainment). At a time when the theatrical dimension of Shakespeare's works was especially ill understood (the plays heavily cut and altered to fit the contemporary stage, and read by Victorian critics as sublime poems rather than as practical scripts), it became possible, perversely, for the fact that Shakespeare had been a known professional actor and man of the theatre to be cited as evidence that he could not have written the plays rather than as corroboration that he did. The spread of conspiracy theories about Shakespeare has an international dimension to it. Both Hart and Bacon were Americans, and blue-blooded candidates for the authorship continue to find some of their most eager (and munificent) supporters in the United States. Members of other nationalities, too, have at times enjoyed the sense that they know the \"real\" Shakespeare better than do his compatriots: during the early 20th century German conspiracy theorists particularly favoured the Earl of Rutland, for example, though their French counterparts preferred the Earl of Derby, and in Austria Sigmund Freud, in a classic instance of the fantasies about secret aristocratic origins which he had identified in children, placed his own ill-informed faith in the Earl of Oxford. The German director Roland Emmerich, then, has belatedly climbed on to a creaky Victorian bandwagon with Anonymous, a film which adopts the most lurid and B-movie-like variant of the theory that Oxford wrote the plays, in its quest to combine the commercial appeal of Shakespeare in Love with that of The Da Vinci Code. According to the scenario the film depicts, the Complete Works, especially Hamlet, encode the story of how Oxford was not only the secret author of the Shakespeare canon but was secretly both the son and subsequently the lover of Elizabeth I, and was thereby secretly the father of the Earl of Southampton and the unacknowledged rightful heir to the throne of England into the bargain. Taken as a serious account of real history, this is so plainly daft, and so wildly at variance with all the copious evidence we have about Shakespeare, the Elizabethan theatre, Oxford, Elizabeth and Southampton alike, that it is beyond rational refutation. Taken as a version of one of our culture's perennially recurring daydreams, however – the tale of the oppressed rightful prince, wickedly deprived of his true heritage and recognition – it ought to give us serious food for thought about the ease with which fantasy, in some minds, can prove far more compelling than mere truth. - Michael Dobson is director of the Shakespeare Institute at the University of Birmingham"

    "title": "Pakistan cricket trio convicted of conspiracy to cheat",
    "content": "Test cricket suffered one of the darkest days in its 134-year history on Tuesday when three former Pakistan internationals were convicted in an English court of spot fixing during a match at the home of cricket, Lord's, in August last year. The former Pakistan captain Salman Butt and his opening bowlers, Mohammad Asif and Mohammad Amir, face up to seven years in jail after the trial closed at Southwark crown court. Asif, who at the time of the match against England was ranked the world's second-best bowler, Amir, who was one of the sport's most exciting prospects, and Butt had been charged with conspiracy to cheat at gambling and to accept corrupt payments. Amir had not been a defendant in the trial but, with the convictions of Butt and Asif on both charges, it is now possible to report that he entered a double guilty plea on 16 September this year, a fact of which the jury was unaware. The evidence against the two bowlers was clear: they delivered no-balls (where the bowler's foot illegally crosses a line on the pitch) at the times predicted by Butt and Amir's agent, Mazhar Majeed, in conversation with the undercover News of the World journalist, Mazhar Mahmood. Majeed believed Mahmood was an Indian match-fixer. Asif and Butt were impassive as the verdicts were read at the culmination of a trial lasting four weeks. For Butt the impact was particularly depressing. His wife gave birth to his second son in Pakistan only 30 minutes after the verdicts. That Amir was a co-conspirator will be difficult for cricket to swallow. At only 18 he already had it all: good looks, flowing locks and the cricketing potential to exceed the exploits of the Pakistan great left-arm fast bowler, Wasim Akram. The teenager had already taken 50 wickets in the fewest Tests, a distinction underscored with an inscription on the bowling honours board at Lord's. In the match that became the focus of the court case, England's batsmen were bewildered by Amir. In one 13-ball spell he accounted for Alastair Cook, Kevin Pietersen, Eoin Morgan and Paul Collingwood without conceding a run. What none in the crown could have known was that two \"massive\" no-balls Amir also delivered were signs that he and two of his teammates were leading double lives as bookmakers' marionettes. \"People who had paid good money to see a professional and exciting game of cricket on the famous ground at Lord's had no idea that what they were watching was not a true game but one where part of the game had been pre-determined for cash,\" said Sally Walsh, a senior lawyer in the Crown Prosecution Service's special crime and counter-terrorism division. \"Butt and Asif denied any wrongdoing but the jury has decided after hearing all the evidence that what happened on the crease that day was criminal in the true sense of the word.\" The court heard of a sophisticated criminal operation. The jury was told how tens of thousands of pounds was carried across borders in attache cases concealed within suitcases. It learned of \"safe\" telephone lines for speaking in secret, and of dealings with the Indian criminal underworld. But for all this to be of any use, there needed to be a fix on the field of play. That, it emerged during the trial, was allegedly organised by Majeed, conveyed to Butt and delivered by Amir and Asif under their captain's direction. As Mr Justice Cooke noted in his summing-up, there was an \"unusual\" weight of evidence in this case, since the charges arose as a result of a sting by Mahmood, posing as a match-fixer. His testimony, taken from behind identity-protecting screens and over two days of occasionally fiery exchanges with defence lawyers, was corroborated by the secret recordings he had made of meetings and telephone calls with Majeed. It meant the jury was afforded a fly-on-the-wall view of the way Majeed conducted his business. His voice was heard as he told Mahmood the precise moments when Amir and Asif would deliver three no-balls during the first two days of the Test, which began at Lord's on August 26. Majeed predicted: \"Whenever Pakistan bowl these balls are definitely happening. It's going to be Amir, he's going to be bowling the third over. First ball of the third over ... whenever he goes round the wicket – last ball of that over will be a no-ball.\" Then, in four words that would also condemn Asif, since his foot also overstepped the mark when he bowled the sixth ball of his own fifth over, Majeed added: \"Tenth over last ball.\" David Kendix, the ICC's scorer at Lord's, who is also a mathematician, insurance-company risk-director and key prosecution witness, estimated that there was a 1.5 million to one chance that Majeed could innocently have alighted on his accurate prediction. The jury watched tapes of a meeting at the Copthorne Tara hotel in west Kensington, on the night before the Lord's Test, when the agent allegedly received £140,000 in marked notes from the journalist. When police searched the hotel three days later they found 30 of the News of the World's £50 notes in Amir's room. A briefcase hidden in a suitcase in Butt's room also contained £2,500 in marked notes. Butt said this was a 50% downpayment on the £5,000 he was due for the grand opening of Majeed's ice cream parlour in Tooting, south London, but his version of events was rejected by the jury. \"These guys wouldn't deal with anyone,\" Majeed had said to Mahmood. \"The only reason they deal with me is because they know my background. I've been dealing with them, the Pakistan team, for about two-and-a-half years, and we've made massive amounts of money. I deal with an Indian party and they pay me.\" But Majeed took an unnecessary risk, opening up to a stranger about his criminal activities in an effort to get paid twice for the same fix. \"I know you, and I have met you, and I'm very good with people and instincts: I believe you are genuine,\" Majeed told the reporter. As Aftab Jafferjee QC, for the prosection, noted: \"That, for Majeed, was to prove a costly mistake. But for others with an interest in the integrity of cricket, it proved to be good fortune.\" During a 13-hour stint in the witness box, longer than any the former Pakistan batsman has spent at the crease in a Test match, Butt was asked to explain a text he received from Majeed while both were at the World Twenty20 tournament in the West Indies in May 2010. It showed Majeed saying: \"Other thing in 7th and 8th over one [wicket] fall in each this will only work if you score in the first two overs and no wickets.\" Butt is a fluent English speaker, but at that point he switched to Punjabi to speak through an interpreter. He claimed to have challenged Majeed over his message, and to have threatened to report him to cricket's anti-corruption authorities. \"[Majeed] said I am just checking if you are doing something dodgy or not,\" claimed Butt. \"I took his word for this explanation.\" Yet within three months of that supposed confrontation, Majeed was taking thousands of pounds from Mahmood, a man he understood to be a match-fixer, and was planning ways for Butt to demonstrate he was \"in on the fix\". Added to anecdotal testimony were patterns of phone calls and texts involving Butt and Majeed – who was also in contact with bookmaking contacts in India and Dubai at the time - at key points while fixes were being arranged. These, along with the £2,500 found in Butt's room, proved enough to convict him. Asif's no-ball came exactly as Majeed had said it would. His explanation that it was \"an accident\" brought on by the \"sledging\" he received from his own captain did not wash with the jury, and although no cash had been found in his room it was clear he had been motivated by a criminally corrupt conspiracy. At one stage during the trial, Butt was asked if he considered it a \"tragedy\" that a player might be corrupted. \"It's the worst thing that can happen to any player of this level,\" he said. Butt knows the true significance of those words today."

    "title": "Gun runner's accomplice found guilty of conspiracy to import",
    "content": "A man has been found guilty of helping an international gun runner to smuggle dozens of handguns into Britain on commercial transatlantic flights. Over a six-month period gun runner Steven Greenoe, 37, – an American who lived in Shrewsbury and is currently awaiting sentence in the US – repeatedly crossed the Atlantic to purchase weapons to sell on to the criminal underworld for a huge profit. He broke the guns down to their component parts and smuggled them into the UK in his luggage. Greenoe's accomplice, Steven Cardwell, 31, of Aintree, Liverpool, was found guilty at Liverpool crown court on Thursday of three charges of conspiracy to import, sell and possess prohibited firearms with intent to enable another person to endanger life, following a four-week trial. He bowed his head in the dock as the jury foreman delivered the verdicts. His family gasped and several sobbed. The jurors were unable to reach verdicts on the allegations against a second man, Neil Copplestone, 32, of Ormskirk, Lancashire, who faces the same charges, and they were discharged. Neil Flewitt QC said the prosecution would seek a retrial. Copplestone was bailed until a later date when a timetable for any new proceedings will be set. Cardwell will be sentenced on Friday. Detective Chief Superintendent Paul Richardson, head of the North West Regional Organised Crime Unit, described Cardwell as Greenoe's \"business director on this side of the pond\". \"Effectively, he was the conduit between Greenoe and criminals within the UK,\" he said. The court heard that Greenoe would fly from Manchester Airport to his home town of Raleigh, North Carolina, where, on 15 separate occasions between February and July 2010, he purchased 81 guns, mostly Glock and Ruger 9mm handguns, at assorted shops. One of the handguns was used in a fatal shooting and others were used in drive-by shootings. Greenoe bought 81 firearms from gun shops in North Carolina, and some of them were smuggled and used in serious criminal offences in the UK. The prosecution said that most, if not all, the firearms purchased by him were intended for or are now in the hands of criminals in the UK, where he lived with his English wife. Security staff at Raleigh-Durham airport in North Carolina found a cache of 16 weapons in Greenoe's luggage when he was stopped while in transit on 25 July 2010. The trial also heard that undercover police officers in Liverpool bought three pistols linked to Greenoe for £3,600 each. Greenoe had paid £300 per gun in the US. Cartridges found at a shooting in Manchester matched guns bought by Greenoe in America, the jury was told. A gun used in the attempted robbery of a Liverpool taxi driver in March 2011 was matched to two guns bought by Greenoe. Greenoe, who claimed to be a former captain in the US Marines and former bodyguard to Madonna, pleaded guilty to two counts of transporting guns outside the US without a federal export licence. Richardson said: \"You would probably describe Greenoe as a Walter Mitty character with falsified documentation about his levels of skills and as a captain in the marines. \"Although he has no criminal background he has proved himself to be a sophisticated liar and a significant threat to the security of America and most certainly the security of the UK.\" Greenoe is due to be sentenced in the US in December."

    "content": "So, here we are, a true picture of this country has emerged over the last few years, and it is characterised by corrupt and greedy bankers, corrupt and greedy politicians, corrupt and greedy police, corrupt and greedy company directors, and a corrupt and greedy media (Report, 19 July). It seems that the entire so-called \"establishment\" in this country is corrupt and controlled, or at least influenced, by the Murdoch-owned press.\n\nFor decades, we have lived in a \"Murdochracy\". This pernicious, ruthless man has used his poisonous influence, afforded him by such witless publications as the Sun and the News of the World, to tell us who to vote for. The British public has been stupid enough to allow this to happen. This has to stop. The question is: is the government brave enough to finally face this man down and break up his rotten empire? No one should have the degree of power he has enjoyed over the years. I suspect they'll do the same thing they did about the excessive greed of the bankers – make a big fuss, make speeches about it, promise to do something, and then … roll over and allow these people to continue to abuse their power and walk all over democracy to feather their own nests. Martin Cooper London • If Lord Justice Leveson is going to do justice to the victims of this scandal (Editorial, July 15), he should also explore the relationship between the previous Labour government and News International, and call former Labour cabinet ministers, including former prime ministers, to give evidence on oath. Ed Miliband is supposed to be having a \"good crisis\", but this is only because his party's historical and institutionalised relationship with News International has not been subjected to the same scrutiny as that of the Conservatives. Tony Blair's 2010 autobiography makes it clear that while there was internal opposition to visiting Murdoch in Hayman Island in June 1995, \"now it seems obvious: the country's most powerful newspaper proprietor, whose publications have hitherto been rancorous in their opposition to the Labour Party, invites us into the lion's den. You go, don't you?\" and that he \"came to have a grudging respect and even liking for\" Murdoch. Instead of Miliband being allowed to construct his party as morally superior, he should also be apologising and cringing at the insidious role Labour has played in the degradation of democratic politics through its obsequious relationship with News International. Professor Joe Sim Liverpool John Moores University • In 2007 Paul Routledge, in a review of Peter Oborne's book The Triumph of the Political Class, wrote: \"Oborne's central thesis is that the old ruling class, of both major parties, has been supplanted by a professional political elite that owes no loyalty except to its own success in winning and retaining power. This group … seeks to consolidate its position by exploiting the media rather than using the institutions of parliament and representative democracy … politics and client journalism were, by the late 1990s, virtually one and the same … it had become natural for the political class and the media class to go out together, holiday together, flirt together, sleep together … \"Increasingly there are dynasties in journalism and politics, moving easily from one to the other. Fundamentally, they believe in the same system and they are engaged in a conspiracy against the voter, thereby creating the conditions for a political culture dominated by 'media events', artifice and deceit. This is one reason why so much reporting of politics now amounts to an elaborate fraud perpetrated upon the British public.\" Routledge did not believe that client journalism would last. I wish that I could share that belief. John Smith Lindfield, West Sussex • The sordid revelations of the past few weeks and years (in the Guardian and Daily Telegraph) suggest that the UK is run by a secretive, intertwining and often kleptocratic nomenklatura worthy of the old Soviet empire.

    "title": "The hacking inquisitors: 'People thought I was a paranoid conspiracy theorist'",
    "content": "The great phone-hacking scandal of 2011 moved like a hurricane through the corridors of British power, blowing open corruption and malpractice and leaving a trail of ruined careers in its wake. But for a small group of players, the exposé has proved their making. In the feature film that will inevitably be made about the incredible events this summer, there are certain to be key roles for three backbench MPs – Tom Watson, Chris Bryant and Louise Mensch – and a lawyer with multiple sclerosis named Mark Lewis. \"This morning I turned down a request to do something on Japanese TV,\" says Lewis, the solicitor who represents several phone-hacking victims, including the family of Milly Dowler. \"There's been an article about my evidence in The Hollywood Reporter and I've been interviewed in New Zealand. I walk down the street and people offer to buy me dinner. I have people send me emails saying, 'You are the modern-day Jesus Christ.' Apart from the fact that we're both Jewish, obviously I'm not.\" Back in 2006, Lewis, who talks with slow deliberation and walks with a slight limp, was a partner in a Manchester practice that represented the Professional Footballers' Association (PFA), the players' union run by Gordon Taylor. Lewis had successfully kept a false story about Taylor out of the News of the World, but when Clive Goodman, the paper's royal correspondent, and the private investigator Glenn Mulcaire were sent to prison in 2007 for phone hacking, Lewis realised how the tabloid had originally got the Taylor story – by misinterpreting a phone message its reporter had illegally accessed. During subsequent negotiations with the newspaper a piece of evidence emerged, an incriminating email from Mulcaire to another News of the World reporter which suggested that phone hacking was widespread. News International decided to pay out around £700,000 to Taylor and his lawyers to put a lid on the scandal. It was a decision that would backfire dramatically. Lewis became aware of the tabloid's working practices, and he began to represent a succession of celebrities who suspected they had been targeted by phone hackers. Slowly the evidence mounted, until the critical revelation earlier this year that the murdered teenager Milly Dowler's phone had been hacked. In an extraordinary few weeks during the summer, the News of the World was closed, the Metropolitan Police commissioner resigned, several leading media figures were arrested, Rupert and James Murdoch appeared before MPs at a House of Commons select committee, News Corp withdrew its bid to buy out BSkyB, party leaders issued apologies for their craven relationship with News International, and a public inquiry was announced. In July, a month before the riots, it seemed as if the powerful nexus of the press, the police and politicians had gone up in flames. Lewis later discovered that he and his ex-wife and children had been placed under surveillance by News International. He says there was a period, when he left his practice in Manchester and moved to London, that he came close to personal and professional destruction. And yet he continued to act for more victims. \"Why am I tenacious?\" he asks. \"It's sort of how I am. I just do it, it's part of my character. I've always been someone who speaks out.\" While damning of the performance of the police, and in particular Andy Hayman (the officer in charge of investigating phone hacking in 2005-2006, and who later took a job with News International), Lewis cites his fellow lawyers Mark Thomson and Charlotte Harris as heroes, along with the Guardian reporter Nick Davies. \"After that,\" he says, \"it was Tom Watson and Chris Bryant, who were pretty much the lone voices among politicians.\" Speaking in a House of Commons cafe, Watson says that when he was appointed to the culture and media select committee in 2009, he had very little knowledge of phone hacking. \"I was quite gauche in my questioning,\" he recalls. \"I asked a question that is now seen as significant, which is, 'Who authorised the money?', because that's what they did during Watergate. It was a kite-flying exercise.\" If nothing else, the defensive response of Colin Myler, the then News of the World editor, and Tom Crone, the News International lawyer, persuaded Watson that the pair were hiding significant information. Watson, too, was placed under surveillance by News International. \"People thought I was a paranoid conspiracy theorist,\" he says. \"I used to come in and say, 'There are two people in a car outside my flat' and my friends would say, 'Who the hell do you think you are?'\" He felt specifically targeted by News International. \"I was finished. My morale had collapsed. They'd done me in. I decided to stand down at the next election.\" Yet Watson didn't collapse, or stand down. His committee published a report in February 2010 that was largely ignored by party leaders who were anxious about the approaching election. But when the select committee was revived in the summer, he became News International's nightmare, a Torquemada to the tabloids. He switched between asking forensic questions and making headline-grabbing statements – he went so far as to accuse James Murdoch of being part of a mafia family. Watson was ably supported by his fellow Labour MP Chris Bryant, who learned in January 2010 that his phone had also been hacked. As far back as 2003, when he drew the admission from Brooks during a select committee hearing that News International made payments to the police, Bryant had made an enemy of the tabloids. Not long afterwards, the Sun and other papers ran a photo of Bryant taken from a gay dating website, in which he appeared in his underpants. He was pursued by stalkers and blackmailers and, he says, he barely slept for three months. \"I had the shakes for a while,\" he says. \"I was a very unhappy person.\" Like Watson, he refused to succumb to the pressure. \"I think Tom and I always knew that there were major revelations to come out. You know when you open the fridge and you know there's something wrong but you don't know where, but if you poke around long enough you'll find it – that's exactly what it was like.\" He speaks of Murdoch and his empire with the steely resolve of a man who knows he's right about what's wrong. \"If you were the chief executive of a global building company and 20 people died in one country because there were not proper safety rules in place, you would be accountable. You couldn't just go, 'I'm sorry, the organisation is awfully big.'\" Watson is worried the Murdochs will yet be given the green light to buy BSkyB. If that does happen, the Conservative MP Louise Mensch will not be unduly concerned. It was Mensch who thrust herself into the world's spotlight when she asked Rupert Murdoch, during select committee questioning, whether he had considered resigning. She maintains that he was right to stay in charge. I ask her if she thinks that she was lied to by witnesses at the select committee hearing. \"I have my views on that but I don't wish to pre-empt the committee report,\" she replies. Yet she has no such misgivings about stating her belief that James Murdoch is innocent of any wrongdoing and should remain in place. \"That's my personal opinion,\" she adds. \"The committee will come to its own conclusion.\" Nor does Mensch believe that News International's conduct should affect its parent company's buyout of BSkyB. \"I think the question doesn't arise,\" she says, no longer the fearless interrogator of Murdoch's power. \"I know a lot of people on the left would like it to arise.\" Certainly Watson and Bryant have no intention of allowing it to drop. \"We're at Act IV, Scene I,\" says Bryant defiantly. \"We won't know the full story, if at all, until people go to prison.\""

And the cost is minimal since you haven't bothered to slap the new logo on any new clothes. Brilliant. That's the conspiracy theory of what happened at Gap. The new logo, abandoned today after a week, certainly seemed to borrow its style from Bench. Gap was also quick to claim it was engaging in a \"crowdsourcing project\" and would be interested in seeing alternative designs. The cock-up theory says Gap's identity crisis – is it a basics brand or a fashion brand? – is more severe than previously thought.

    "title": "How WikiLeaks killed the conspiracy thriller",
    "content": "It's a scene familiar from countless conspiracy thrillers: in a starkly lit underground bunker full of blinking monitors and whirring cold war-era machinery, a high-ranking military official yanks the cigar from his mouth and barks: \"But if this information gets into the wrong hands, there's gonna be a revolution! Get me the president!\" At least, it used to be a familiar scene. Because the events of this week have largely rendered it redundant. You see, that information really did get out – in the form of the leaked US embassy cables – and the reaction has generally been less of a revolution and more of an absent-minded tutting. This might be a wild generalisation, but the public at large seems to have been totally underwhelmed by the contents of the cables, responding by either writing \"LOL Prince Andrew\" on Twitter or getting distracted by the snow and hopping up and down in front of their windows like a bunch of giddy schoolchildren. This will be an enormous headache for Hollywood. Conspiracy thrillers tend to pivot around the assumption that the public – those seething militants trapped in their low-boiling stew of civil unrest – will rise up and expose the fragility of international diplomacy for what it is once a dangerous state secret gets out in the open. But if WikiLeaks has taught us anything, it's that the bulk of the population already has enough on its plate, without having to care about whether or not America is spying on Ban Ki-Moon as well. Earlier this week, Interpol put WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange on something called \"red notice\" for an alleged sex offence. Politicians are calling for him to be executed as a terrorist. It's real Enemy of the State stuff, but nobody is batting an eyelid. The central myth of all these films – that people care – has just been exploded forever. And it's not as if much can be done about it, either. What choices do producers of these thrillers have? Rewrite the bunker scene so the official barks: \"But if this information gets into the wrong hands, Krishnan Guru-Murthy from Channel 4 news is gonna get his knickers in a twist for about 20 minutes! Get me a sandwich!\"? Change the state secret to something that would genuinely cause civil unrest, such as a file containing proof that One Direction really were miming on Saturday's X Factor? Either way, the outcome is bound to be rubbish. Not that any of this should be a surprise. Real life can never hope to live up to cinema's dramatic perfection. For example, look at The Hunt for Red October – a nail-biting thriller about a commanding officer who takes an undetectable, state-of-the-art nuclear submarine rogue, with potentially catastrophic global consequences. Something fairly similar to this happened recently, except the commanding officer didn't take his undetectable, state-of-the-art nuclear submarine rogue. He got it stuck in some silt just off the coast of Scotland. And, rather than a potential global catastrophe, the only real consequence was mild national humiliation and about four jokes on Have I Got News for You. Conspiracy thrillers aren't the only films that can be spoiled by real-life events. Any planned Raoul Moat biopic is doomed to failure. In theory, it could be a classic story – a battle of wits between one man and the rest of the world; part Dog Day Afternoon, part First Blood. But it simply wouldn't work. It doesn't matter how much creeping atmosphere or tightly woven backstory it contains, or whether it asks questions about the extent to which Moat was the product of a broken system. This is because if a Raoul Moat movie wanted to be true to real-life events, then at some point near the end of the second act – right at the moment when the police have Moat cornered and the tension ramps up to such an unbearable degree that viewers don't know if they can take the suspense – Gazza would have to pop up, looking all bleary and dishevelled, clutching four cans of lager, some chicken, a fishing rod and a couple of dressing gowns. He'd half-heartedly shout \"Moaty! It's Gazza!\" a few times and then wander off. It'd kill the drama in an instant. It doesn't end there. Prince William's upcoming wedding to Kate Middleton might seem perfect to transform into a Hollywood fairytale. However, to accurately capture the mood of the public, all the glitz and pomp of the occasion would inevitably have to be punctured by the scene where the vast majority of the prince's loyal subjects refuse to care until they're assured that they'll definitely get a day off work out of it. And anybody planning to turn the recent tuition-fee protests into an epic, Braveheart-style battle movie must face up to the uncomfortable truth that everyone on the Braveheart side of the battle will a) fight to the sound of genuinely bad dance music, b) uniformly have haircuts that everyone will be slightly ashamed of in 15 years and c) won't actually do much in the way of fighting in case their mobile phone ends up getting smashed during a skirmish with a community support officer. That said, sometimes real life can intervene and improve films. As soon as the story broke that 33 Chilean miners had been trapped deep beneath the ground earlier this year, and that they'd stay there for months until geological engineers had formulated a method to retrieve them all safely, you can guarantee that dozens of writers all had precisely the same hokey script idea. A tense, claustrophobic – possibly cannibalistic – psychological thriller in which grown men begin to lose their minds and turn on each other inside a painfully enclosed space. But then, just as the first drafts were being completed, out popped Edison Pena, the charming, casually inspirational marathon-running miner who kept turning up on chatshows to do his hilarious Elvis impersonation. Suddenly, ripping off Buried started to look like entirely the wrong approach, because the real story was a cross between Forrest Gump and Roberto Benigni's 1998 \"I use up all my English!\" Oscar speech, which, admit it, you'd actually prefer to watch. But in the end, though, none of this should matter. Movies have always put entertainment over historical accuracy. That's why, when filming Titanic, James Cameron transformed First Officer William McMaster Murdoch into a bribe-taking heel despite the memorial in tribute to his bravery that had been erected in his hometown. And it's why 2000's U-571 famously rode roughshod over any sense of reality in favour of simply telling an entertaining story. The fact that it failed to even tell a vaguely mediocre story – and then cast Jon Bon Jovi to rub salt into everyone's wounds – is neither here nor there. So perhaps that's why, when WikiLeaks: The Motion Picture eventually goes into production, the official really will stand in his bunker, cigar in his hand, roaring to anyone who'll listen that the leaked US embassy cables will kickstart a revolution. And perhaps, in the film, he'll be right – instead of being met with deafening apathy, the leaks will cause diplomatic tensions to explode around the world, leading to a spontaneous citizen uprising on the streets that tears apart everyone's preconceived ideas of power and authority. And when that day comes, and the film – containing a scene where an outraged member of the public throws a metal dustbin through a KFC window out of blind fury that someone once dared to secretly tell an ambassador that George Osborne has a moderately high-pitched speaking voice – is released, I'll be first in the queue."

    "title": "The Telegraph, Cable and Murdoch conspiracy theories mount",
    "content": "The Daily Telegraph's decision to hold back Cable's explosive comments on Rupert Murdoch on Tuesday has prompted a feverish outbreak of conspiracy theorising across Fleet Street. Yet, Telegraph executives insist that they always planned to publish Cable's declaration of war against Murdoch on the Wednesday, a day after their original \"I could bring the coalition down\" front page. Their argument is that the Telegraph is not 'obsessed' by media stories and so wanted to publish other (less interesting) revelations first. That may well be so, although Cable's comments were no mere 'media story' – had he declared war against Tesco or Barclays, the Lib Dem's fitness to be business secretary was always going to be in serious doubt. What was more astonishing, of course, was the fact that both the text and the audio of Cable's comments were leaked to Robert Peston of the BBC – by what the BBC business editor described as a whistleblower from the Telegraph. Although talk of this is downplayed by Telegraph executives, various sources indicate that there is a 'leak inquiry' of sorts going on. And there is even a fairly developed theory over at the Telegraph as to how the story got out from a small number of people in the know in the newsroom to the BBC, although at the time of writing there is no sign that it has been proved. Journalists may be a pretty gossipy bunch, but an overt leak from a Fleet Street newsroom is incredibly rare. Reporters know better than to discuss what is on a newslist with rivals – and passing on actual passages from draft articles or interview transcripts is seen as beyond the pale. If caught, there is little chance of the leaker keeping their job – even if the alleged justification is that Cable's comments were being held back because they were inconvenient to the wider campaign (of which the Telegraph Media Group is part) to get the News Corporation-Sky deal blocked by Vince Cable.\n\nPeston also accused the Telegraph of omitting the Cable/Murdoch comments in a transcript of the original covert recording, published Tuesday. The BBC journalist said, citing online copy, that the Telegraph had claimed it had published a \"full transcript\". However, in the printed edition, the newspaper was careful to describe it as only a \"transcript\". Whether the use of full was simply an error or not is not clear, but the use of the words full transcript online was again – apparently – not intended. Anyway, what is curious is the Telegraph's reluctance to defend itself in public. In old Fleet Street style, the newspaper seems to believe that there is no case to answer to the outside world, and has restricted itself to a couple of statements saying it is \"utter nonsense\" to suggest that Cable's Murdoch remarks were held back for \"commercial reasons\". Tony Gallagher, the editor, has remained silent while others criticise his title (yes, I've rung), while there has been only the most minimal reference to the leak saga in the newspaper itself. Wednesday's front page story about the Cable revelation simply relegated the fact of the leak to the BBC to a short mention in the middle of the second column. Editorial commentary on the subject has been limited too. There was no leader in the Telegraph on Tuesday – day one of the Lib Dem revelations. Again there was no leader on the Wednesday, which would have been an obvious point to try and answer the questions raised by the BBC leak. There is a leader today, but the leak subject is not touched on. Nor, indeed, is the whole question about whether the use of covert recording, of journalists posing as constituents is justified – a debatable editorial technique that was criticised by Nick Robinson on the Today programme yesterday (listen from 10m50s in). Perhaps, then, there is no case to answer about why the Cable/Murdoch story was held back. Perhaps \"Fake Sheikh\" covert recording of MPs is fair enough. But as the Telegraph fails to explain itself, over at Wapping little time has been wasted in suggesting that those who have opposed the News Corp/Sky transaction (including this newspaper) are not high-minded types worried about plurality in the media. Ah no, they are the more grubby sort who will try anything on. That is far from correct, but the way the past few days have played out have hardly advanced the cause of the critics of Murdoch influence and power."

    "content": "MI6 codebreaker Gareth Williams, whose decomposing body was found locked inside a sports bag four months ago, is the latest addition to a small group whose unexplained deaths provide fodder for conspiracy theorists. An early entrant to the club was Lionel \"Buster\" Crabb, an MI6 diver who in 1956 was dispatched into Portsmouth harbour to reconnoitre a Russian ship and was never seen again. A headless and handless corpse was found in the vicinity a year later, but there was no proof it was Crabb. One of the most famous unsolved deaths is that of Roberto Calvi, found hanging from Blackfriars Bridge in 1982. Suggestions that the Italian financier, who is alleged to have had links to the Vatican, the mafia and freemasonry, took his own life were dispelled and his death was classed as murder. Five people were tried in Rome in 2007 for the killing, but no one was convicted. In 1978, Georgi Markov, a Bulgarian communist defector living in London, died after being stabbed in the thigh by a man holding an umbrella. A postmortem examination established that he had been killed by a tiny pellet containing the poison ricin. No one was charged and the subsequent deaths of those believed to have sanctioned the killing helped to perpetuate interest in the case. Markov's death bore similarities to the murder of Alexander Litvinenko, who was poisoned in 2006 by suspected Russian agents but, again, no one was charged. The police have cooled towards the idea that Williams's death was linked to his job, but if he had not worked for MI6 it would have gained little attention. Fascination with his demise will end only if the case is proven conclusively to have had nothing to do with his secret service activities."

(C) Summary: On the floor of parliament, Indian Home Minister P. Chidambaram officially dismissed comments made by the Minority Affairs Minister A.R. Antulay that implied Hindutva elements may have been involved in the Mumbai attacks. Antulay sparked a political controversy on December 17 with comments insinuating that the killing of Maharashtra Anti-Terror Squad (ATS) Chief Hemant Karkare by the Mumbai terrorists was somehow linked to Karkare's investigation of bombings in which radical Hindus are suspected (reftel). The outlandish comments suggested that somehow Hindutva elements were in league with the Mumbai attackers, or used the attacks as cover to kill Karkare. The opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) immediately called for Antulay's resignation and protested with boisterous walkouts in parliament over the course of five days. Compounding matters, the Congress Party, after first distancing itself from the comments, two days later issued a contradictory statement which implicitly endorsed the conspiracy. During this time, Antulay's completely unsubstantiated claims gained support in the conspiracy-minded Indian-Muslim community. Hoping to foster that support for upcoming national elections, the Congress Party cynically pulled back from its original dismissal and lent credence to the conspiracy. Regardless of Chidambaram's dismissal (and Antulay's party-ordered retraction), the Indian Muslim community will continue to believe they are unfairly targeted by law enforcement and that those who investigate the truth are silenced. The entire episode demonstrates that the Congress Party will readily stoop to the old caste/religious-based politics if it feels it is in its interest. End Summary. Killed in Mumbai Attacks, Karkare Led Investigation into \"Hindu Terror\" --------------------------------------------- 2. (U) Indian Minorities Affairs Minister A.R. Antulay's sparked controversy on December 17 with comments insinuating that the killing of Maharashtra Anti-Terror Squad (ATS) Chief Hemant Karkare by the Mumbai terrorists was somehow linked to Karkare's investigation of \"Hindu terrorists.\" Two of the Mumbai terrorists gunned down Karkare, and his ATS colleagues Additional Commissioner of Police Ashok Kamte and Inspector Vijay Salaskar the first night of attacks, November 26. The three officers were killed as they reached a hospital the terrorists entered after attacking the Mumbai train station. 3. (U) As Maharashtra ATS Chief, Karkare led the investigation into the September 2008 Malegaon blasts which claimed the lives of six people. Initially the police suspected Muslim terrorists. However, authorities recently arrested eleven Hindus, including an Indian Army Lieutenant Colonel. Police identified five of those arrested as having ties to the BJP's youth wing in their earlier years. Two others had ties to a recent addition to the Sangh Parivar family of Hindu nationalist organizations. Antulay's Comments ------------------ 4. (U) On December 17, even as a solemn debate on the Mumbai attacks and counterterrorism was taking place in parliament, Antulay made a series of public comments drawing attention to a possible link between Karkare's killing and his investigation. He offered no evidence to back-up his claims. -- \"Superficially speaking they had no reason to kill Karkare. Whether he was a victim of terrorism or terrorism plus something, I do not know.\" -- \"Karkare found that there are non Muslims involved in the NEW DELHI 00003228 002 OF 002 acts of terrorism during his investigations in some cases. Any person going to the roots of terrorism has always been the target.\" -- \"Unfortunately his end came. It may be a separate inquiry how his end came.\" -- \"There is more than what meets the eyes.\" Congress Party Dismisses... --------------------------- 5. (U) Most Congress Party leaders quickly disassociated the Party from Atulay's comments. Congress Party spokesman Abishek Singhvi told the press, \"We do not accept the innuendo and the aspersions cast. This should be the end of the matter. The Congress does not agree with Antulay's statement.\" Another Congress Party spokesman, Manish Tiwari, followed the next day with, \"The Congress in any manner does not endorse Antulay's views.\" Just as quickly BJP leaders called for Antulay to resign or be sacked. ...Then Equivocates... ---------------------- 6. (U) However, on December 21 senior Congress leader Digvijay Singh told the media, \"I don't think Antulay made a mistake. What he asked for is a probe. What is objectionable in his statement?\" Two days earlier the Congress-led government of Maharashtra rejected a demand for an inquiry into Karkare's death. The opposition BJP took exception to both the substance of Antulay's comments and the Congress Party's inconsistent response. Shouting slogans, the BJP staged a walkout in the parliament three days in a row and demanded a formal clarification from the government. Emboldened by the equivocation, Antulay refused to apologize or retract his statements and said they reflected the views of a large segment of the Muslim population. ...And Finally Dismisses ------------------------ 7. (U) After taking flack for nearly a week, the Congress Party finally gave its official view when Home Minister Chidambaram stated in parliament, \"There is no truth whatsoever in the suspicion that there was conspiracy.\" Chidambaram called Antulay's comments \"regrettable.\" Shortly thereafter Antulay backed down and told the press, \"For me the matter is settled.\" He ruled out his resignation. Congress Party Plays Cynical Politics ------------------------------------- 8. (C) Comment: While the killing of three high level law enforcement officers during the Mumbai attacks is a remarkable coincidence, the Congress Party's initial reaction to Antulay's outrageous comments was correct. But as support seemed to swell among Muslims for Antulay's unsubstantiated claims, crass political opportunism swayed the thinking of some Congress Party leaders. What's more, the party made the cynical political calculation to lend credence to the conspiracy even after its recent emboldening state elections victories. The party chose to pander to Muslims' fears, providing impetus for those in the Muslim community who will continue to play up the conspiracy theory. While cooler heads eventually prevailed within the Congress leadership, the idea that the party would entertain such outlandish claims proved once again that many party leaders are still wedded to the old identity politics. The seventy-nine year old Antulay was probably bewildered to find that his remarks, similar in vein to what he would have routinely made in the past to attack the BJP, created such a furor this time.

    "title": "Anna Nicole Smith: two guilty of drugs conspiracy",
    "content": "Anna Nicole Smith's boyfriend and psychiatrist have been found guilty of conspiring to give the late Playboy model drugs. After a two month trial, a Los Angeles court convicted Howard K Stern and Khristine Eroshevich for conspiring to give her excessive amounts of painkillers, antidepressants and other prescription drugs. They were both acquitted of other charges. A second doctor, Sandeep Kapoor, was acquitted on all charges. Stern, Eroshevich and Kapoor, had all pleaded not guilty to multiple charges of fraudulently providing drugs and controlled substances to a known addict. The three were not charged over the death of Smith, who was best known for marrying an 89-year-old oil Texan oil billionaire, J Howard Marshall, when she was 26. She died on 8 February 2007 at age 39 from an accidental prescription drug overdose. At the time of her death, her legal battle for a share of the $1.6 billion fortune of her late husband was ongoing. It has been carried forward by Stern, the executor of Smith's estate. The jury reached its split verdict after 13 days of deliberations following a trial that saw the judge criticise prosecutors for being overly aggressive and throw out some of the original charges. Prosecutors said the three defendants conspired to provide Smith with a cocktail of painkillers, muscle relaxants, anti-depressants and anti-anxiety drugs by writing or seeking prescriptions using several false names. Defence lawyers said their clients cared for Smith and would not harm her, and argued she used the drugs to help her sleep and control severe pain. After his acquittal, Kapoor said: \"This is not just a victory for me, but for patients everywhere who suffer chronic pain.\" His lawyer Ellyn Garofalo said it also was a victory in some ways for Smith. \"The jury found she was not an addict,\" Garofolo said. The only conviction against Stern was for giving false names and acting by fraud to obtain prescriptions. Along with conspiracy, Eroshevich was convicted of unlawfully prescribing Vicodin by fraud. Stern and Eroshevich now face a hearing on 6 January 2011 in which their defence lawyers can file a motion for a new trial. If the motion is denied, the judge can sentence both defendants, but it was not immediately clear how much prison time, if any, they could face. Stern, 41, had been Smith's lawyer, manager, lover and friend since they met in 2001. Testimony showed they were inseparable, even when she was involved with other men. In 2006, Smith donned a wedding gown, and she and Stern had a commitment ceremony on a catamaran off the Bahamas. They exchanged rings and vows but were never legally married. At the heart of the drug case was the question of whether Smith became dependent on opiates and sedatives after being diagnosed and treated for chronic pain syndrome and illnesses including seizures, migraines and spinal pain. Superior Court Judge Robert Perry told the jury of six women and six men that a doctor who has a good faith belief that a patient is in pain is not guilty of a crime for prescribing controlled substances to relieve suffering. While presenting their case, prosecutors displayed multiple prescriptions to Smith for heavy painkillers such as Dilaudid, Demarol, Vicodin and methadone, as well as anti-anxiety drugs and sedatives including Ambien, Xanax, Valium and Chloral Hydrate. In one month, they said, Smith received 1,500 pills. The judge, however, warned that numbers of pills were not the measure of addiction. \"To violate (the law) a defendant must willfully and knowingly prescribe, administer or dispense a controlled substance to an addict for a non-therapeutic purpose,\" Perry instructed the jury. The story of Smith's final years stretched from Los Angeles to the Bahamas with stops along the way in South Carolina and Florida, where her overdose death at the age of 39 was ruled accidental. The two doctors also were close to Smith during her final years, and their lawyers portrayed them as angels of mercy trying to help her before and after she gave birth to her daughter by caesarean then quickly lost her 20-year-old son, Daniel, to a drug overdose. He died in her hospital room after coming to visit his new half-sister on 10 September 2006. Smith later named the baby Dannielynn in his memory. Stern initially claimed the baby was his until DNA tests made clear the father was photographer Larry Birkhead, who now has custody of the child. Defence attorney Steve Sadow, who represents Stern, said Smith was the love of his client's life and he would never harm her. He also stressed that Stern was not a doctor and was relying on medical professionals to do the right thing for Smith. Stern's name was on a number of prescriptions which prosecutors said were intended for Smith. Kapoor, 42, who was Smith's internist, wrote numerous prescriptions for opiates and sedatives during the period he treated her. His lawyer said he followed a drug regime originated by Smith's previous doctor who sold his practice to Kapoor. Prosecutors Renee Rose and David Barkhurst argued that Kapoor blurred the line between patient and doctor when he was photographed kissing her at a party. They also pointed to a diary in which Kapoor discussed the \"mesmerising\" experience of riding with her in a gay pride parade and wondered: \"Can she ruin me?\" Eroshevich, 63, was Smith's neighbour and friend before treating her as a psychiatrist. Prosecutors claimed the friendship was a violation of professional ethics and called a pharmacist who testified the amount of drugs Eroshevich requested for Smith at one point would have amounted to pharmaceutical suicide. The pharmacist refused to fill the request, and prosecutors showed Eroshevich used other pharmacies to get most of the drugs and took them to Smith in the Bahamas. They also showed jurors photos of Eroshevich naked in a bathtub with Smith as they contended the doctor also lost her objectivity about treatment. Attorney Brad Brunon, who represents Eroshevich, said prosecutors were trying to prejudice jurors with something irrelevant. \"People on the ground saw her as caring for Anna Nicole Smith,\" Brunon said of Eroshevich. \"And what is her reward? She's dragged through this, her name is ruined, and she's publicly humiliated.\""

    "title": "Conspiracy theories are corroding our society | Jamie Bartlett",
    "content": "It has been quite a week for conspiracy theories. First, the case of Dr David Kelly was revisited, accompanied by claims that he has been murdered at the behest of Tony Blair; then an MI6/GCHQ agent was found dead in his flat, which has sparked a new wave of speculation. Not all conspiracies are false of course: last week's investigation into the Claudy bombing revealed that the UK government had covered up a Catholic priest's involvement and new sources suggest the CIA tested the effects of LSD in Pont-Saint-Esprit. Next week, on the ninth anniversary of 9/11, there are dozens of events dedicated to proving that the attacks were an inside job. Conspiracy theories are often dismissed as a harmless irritation. The idea that all is not as it seems, that a small cabal of powerful people control world events has always been with us. But in recent years they have become a widespread and influential cultural phenomenon. In some contexts, they may have serious social implications. In The Power of Unreason, a Demos report released last Sunday, we looked at the role of conspiracy theories in extremist groups, violent ideologies and radical doctrine. We analysed more than 50 extremist groups from across the spectrum (far-right, left, religious, cult, anarchic), and found conspiracy theories to be at the heart of a lot of them. We argued they are a \"radicalising multiplier\", which, when combined with extremist ideology, can push groups and individuals in a more radical direction. Timothy McVeigh, the Angry Brigade, Combat 18, the Peoples Temple – were all fervent conspiracists. Not only that, these theories clearly harm trust in government, in particular counter-terrorism work, in ways not fully understood. Therefore, something should be done about them. But this is the rub of course, because conspiracy theories are self-sealing. Any attempts, especially by government, risks \"proving\" the theory itself (if a government goes to the effort of rebutting them, surely there must be something in it). Instead, civil society must play a stronger role in engaging with conspiracy theories where they find them, and the education system needs to do more to equip young people with critical thinking skills, especially in respect of the net. More generally, security services can be more open in a number of, admittedly limited, areas such as reviewing the laws on disclosure of information, making counter-terrorism trial transcripts more widely available, and sharing more classified information with communities affected by counter-terrorism arrests. This can be done without jeopardising national or individuals' security. This won't make conspiracy theories go away. Especially when, as the Claudy case shows, our government does routinely cover things up. The challenge facing us can be demonstrated by the immediate unleashing of baseless vitriol and bile at myself and co-author within minutes of the paper's release. We were accused by many 9/11 \"truthers\" (even though the paper was not about them) of being paid disinformation agents, or government patsies that are trying to indoctrinate children and cover up the truth of an emerging New World Order. Even the letter \"o\" in our logo is apparently proof of Demos' duplicity, because it looks rather like \"an all seeing eye\". This is all in spite of the fact that we called for greater openness and support critical thinking – something the truthers themselves claim to support too. We certainly need healthy scepticism. But conspiracy theories are kneejerk, lazy cynicism. We need to limit their corrosive and destructive impact. The government lacks the credibility to do so. It falls on the rest of us to act."

    "title": "Manchester United reject conspiracy theory over Wayne Rooney",
    "content": "Manchester United are adamant Wayne Rooney will see out his new five-year deal and have dismissed the conspiracy theory that the club agreed to an expensive long contract extension to protect their own interests by raising his future transfer fee. Sources say there \"is absolutely no chance\" Rooney will agitate for a move from Old Trafford to Eastlands again next summer. Some analysts suspect United paid over the odds to keep him so that Manchester City would need to hand over £50-80m rather than the £25m they might have expected to pay in January. With only 18 months left on his existing deal, which expired in the summer of 2012, Rooney's transfer value would have been reduced and United would have faced a bill of £30m-plus to buy a proven replacement. United maintain the saga is over and that the willingness of the Glazer family to smash the club's wage structure to double Rooney's salary conspired with the player's growing sense of isolation to produce his screeching U-turn. Rooney is said to have been deeply unsettled by the hostility his behaviour had provoked among his fellow United players and by Sir Alex Ferguson's insistence that he was making a calamitous mistake. As his team prepared to face Stoke at the Britannia Stadium today, Ferguson was savouring perhaps his greatest diplomatic coup as United manager. He used carefully nuanced press statements and paternal pressure on Rooney himself to open him up to an improved offer from the Glazers. Some reports placed Rooney's new weekly wage at £230,000 but £200,000 is believed to be closer to the mark. The team's season has yet to ignite but Ferguson believes the resolution of the Rooney saga will provide a catalyst at Stoke. United have drawn five of their eight Premier League games and surrendered two-goal leads against Everton and West Brom. England's senior striker misses the match with an ankle injury but Ferguson said: \"We have to start making up ground quickly. We can only do that with everyone on board, with no one jumping ship. Then we can see the real Manchester United.\" David Beckham, who left United for Real Madrid in acrimonious circumstances, said: \"I am a Manchester United fan myself, and the supporters should be happy. It can be put to bed. I'm not surprised he's staying at Manchester United because they're the biggest club in the world. And he's got the best manager that will look after him at all times. My situation was totally different. If I'd had the chance to stay at Manchester United I would have.\" Rooney is believed by United to have developed his urge to move to City at the World Cup, where conversations about how much players are earning at various clubs invariably prompt restlessness when the tournament is over. In coveting first John Terry and now Rooney (there is no suggestion of tapping up by City), United's neighbours have succeeded only in securing huge pay rises for two of England's most influential players. Paul Stretford, Rooney's agent, stood to gain most by moving his client across town or to Real Madrid but can still claim a notable victory over the Glazers, who were forced to pay far more than they intended when the player's new pay offer was first drawn up. But there is lingering bitterness over Stretford's possible role in the Rooney press release that accused United of not matching the striker's \"ambitions\". One cloud over the deal is that other senior United players will now see Rooney's astronomical salary as the new benchmark, and will adjust their own wage demands accordingly. The onus for dealing with these raised expectations will fall first on the chief executive, David Gill, another with a star rating from the Rooney negotiations, but ultimately on the Glazers, who pay the bills in the shadow of a vast corporate debt."

The former topless model died of an accidental overdose in 2007 aged 39. The prescriptions were issued between June 2004 and January 2007, just weeks before Smith's death. When she died, investigators found more than 600 pills – including about 450 muscle relaxants – were missing from prescriptions that were no more than five weeks old. Ultimately, it was a syrup, the powerful sleeping aid chloral hydrate, that was blamed with tipping the balance in the toxic mix of drugs and causing her death.

After his death the following year she was drawn into a lengthy legal battle over the settlement of his $1.6bn fortune.

    "title": "Paul the octopus is dead – but conspiracy theories are thriving",
    "content": "No sooner had death's tentacles slackened their grip on Paul's squidgy body than the first conspiracy theory concerning his demise emerged like a cephalopod from a crevice. Not everyone, it seems, is prepared to accept the news that the \"psychic\" octopus – who made such a splash over the summer by successfully predicting the results of World Cup games – passed away on Monday in the comfort of the German aquarium he called home. According to Jiang Xiao, the director of a forthcoming thriller entitled Who Killed Paul the Octopus?, the creature had really been dead for the last three months. Jiang told the Guardian she was \"60 to 70% sure\" Paul had died in July and been secretly replaced by his keepers. Explaining how such a deception could have been perpetrated, she added: \"[Octopuses] all look the same. It is impossible to tell the difference.\" Jiang said she thought it was \"kind of strange\" that news of Paul's death had broken not long after the Oberhausen Sea Life Centre in western Germany had contacted her team to say they were keen to co-operate on the international distribution of her film. \"We have been keeping in touch with the German aquarium ever since the beginning [of production] but it seemed to me that they were afraid,\" she said. \"The movie is about unveiling the inside story behind the octopus miracle, so they felt nervous. \"For the movie, we had done quite a lot of investigation and I am 60% to 70% sure that Paul died on 9 July [two days before the World Cup final] and the Germans have been covering up his death and fooling us for a long time.\" Jiang declined to explain why she believed Paul had died in July — or to say more about the revelations in the movie. Her allegations of submarine jiggery-pokery met with polite bafflement in Germany today. \"It's certainly not true that Paul died in the summer,\" said a spokeswoman for the aquarium. \"We can absolutely assure you that he died last night. He was about two and a half, which is the average age for an octopus. He died a simple and straightforward death.\" Paul is due to be cremated in the next few days. His ashes will be placed in an urn and displayed in a shrine, along with a portrait and video clips from his life, the spokeswoman added. \"We've already set up a condolence book where people can write their tributes to Paul,\" she said. But what of the rumours that Paul had pulled off one last magnificent psychic coup by predicting his own death? \"If he did, he kept it to himself,\" she said."

    "title": "Pakistan's conspiracy cottage industry | Mustafa Qadri",
    "content": "Although the Taliban have openly claimed responsibility for the recent epidemic of suicide bombings against civilian targets in Peshawar and Islamabad, many Pakistanis appear convinced that the real culprits are India or the United States. \"These are India's agents,\" an anti-narcotics bureaucrat tells me in Islamabad with a confident grin. With its operatives active in a string of Indian consulates along the Pak-Afghan border, so goes the popular claim, they direct New Delhi's latest attempt to topple the Islamic Republic. It is a common refrain in Pakistan. In fact, so common, that almost everyone I venture to ask blames the Indians, or Americans, or foreigners for the terrorism. The country has faced many crises over the years, but these are particularly unsettling days. In the past, violence tended to be unilateral: avoid the angry mob on days of protest, neighbourhoods patrolled by gangs, or criticising vocal mullahs and life was generally quiet. But today's enemy moves with stealth and could be anywhere. Already poor migrants from Afghanistan and the central Asian republics have been evicted from the slums of Islamabad, Rawalpindi and Karachi on the suspicion that someone among their numbers is responsible for the violence. But these are just the small fry, and even the media and the government claim there is good intelligence implicating foreign powers. So where, one has to ask, do these rumours come from? There are three broad explanations. First, this is a traumatised country that is justifiably in shock over the extent to which violence has become an everyday reality. The images of fellow Pakistani men, women and children being martyred on our television screens has a deep impact too. It is only human to look at outside forces to explain this chaos – surely we couldn't be doing this to ourselves? There must be a foreign conspiracy against our country. Linked to this is a powerful denial complex that is not unique to Pakistan. Much as most Americans refuse to reflect on their own government's past support for Osama bin Laden, there is widespread incredulity over the radicalisation of organised Islam in Pakistan. Because the state itself has historically encouraged client jihadi organisations there is limited public discourse on the militarisation of Islamic doctrine in Pakistan. When these groups kill ordinary Pakistanis, as a consequence, few are willing to accept people from their own towns and provinces are responsible. A third factor that influences conspiracy theories is that there is occasionally evidence to suggest foreign involvement in the violence. After the Iranian revolution of 1979, Iran and Saudi Arabia exported Islamist militancy to their Pakistani co-religionists in a petty confrontation of regional empires that sowed the seeds for today's brutal Shia-Sunni violence. The United States has a long history of clandestinely supporting Islamist militancy in Pakistan. When Iran blamed the US for the audacious murder of high profile Iranian Revolutionary Guard members last month, many in Pakistan saw this is as further proof of American involvement in terrorism in the region, including their own country. Added to the intrigue is the fact that for years the US mysteriously refused to kill former Pakistan Taliban chief Baitullah Mehsud via remote drone despite being offered his precise location by Pakistani intelligence authorities. Influence of the Israel lobby on American foreign policy in the Middle East is another source of conspiracy theories in Pakistan. When in April Israeli foreign minister Avigdor Lieberman said Pakistan was a greater threat to his country than Iran, many saw it as confirmation of the most strident conspiracy theory here, namely that Israel is clandestinely orchestrating the present mayhem. Of course none of this proves the conspiracy theories to be correct. Rather, they suggest a false reading of history and social dynamics by many Pakistanis. In the world of the conspiracy, powerful actors are not merely mortals with influence but rather god-like beings who direct geopolitics like an opera, and that is just how the powerful often appear to be in this country. By marshalling conspiracy theories many people, not just in Pakistan, abdicate responsibility for confronting the ills their societies face. If you are playing cards with a cheat, is there any point in trying to get a better hand? \"But what is the common man to do?\" retorts science tutor Imran during a random encounter outside my uncle's house. It is a valid point. With so much out of the ordinary citizen's hands, it is easy to believe Pakistan's problems are all down to hidden designs."

    "title": "Afghan conspiracy theories | Nushin Arbabzadah",
    "content": "They parted ways but not without a smile, and a friendly squeeze of the arm. The atmosphere was relaxed. \"Give me a Kalashnikov,\" said the Talib. And without complaining, the policeman took the gun from his shoulder and handed it to the Talib. The rest of the video showed a larger group of policemen and Taliban chatting and milling around together amid what seems to have been a larger handing over of weapons. This surreally sociable encounter between what are meant to be enemy parties took place in Baghlan province in northern Afghanistan recently. A Taliban fighter filmed it and sent it to the BBC. His message: even the police force has sided with the Taliban. The Afghan interior ministry was quick to dismiss the video as Taliban propaganda, implying the film was a forgery. An article in Sorush-e Mellat was worded along similar lines, speculating that the Taliban had staged the meeting to make the public lose trust in the Afghan government. If this is true, the Taliban are fighting a pointless battle because the public has already lost trust in Kabul. The fraud-ridden presidential election did the Taliban's job for them in undermining the credibility of the central government. Be that as it may, the video's reception on the part of the government, the public and the media was revealing. What is particularly interesting is that what might seem to a non-Afghan audience the most obvious interpretation of the event – as a run-of-the-mill act of police corruption – is the one that has been least accepted by Afghan commentators. Instead, in line with the Afghan penchant for seeing political motivations and machinations everywhere, most commentators have seen the encounter as suggesting a political strategy rather than financial transaction. Thus, for some, the meeting represented an example of Pashtun ethnic solidarity overriding loyalty to the nation as a whole. This is because the conversation between the police and Taliban in the video was conducted in Pashto, in a relaxed and friendly manner. Critics have often accused President Karzai of deliberately allowing emotional attachment to ethnic affiliation to compromise the country's security and institution-building. Karzai's refusal to pursue a consistent aggressive policy with regard to the Taliban has been interpreted in this light. Critics argue that the chain of ethnic loyalty begins at ministries in Kabul, infiltrating the police force and reaching the Taliban, as evidenced in the film. The theory is neat, but there's a serious flaw. Pashtun civilians have died in their thousands in Nato airstrikes, and Kabul has done little to protect them. Karzai may offer peace to the Taliban but the people in the south and east are dying nonetheless. Ethnic solidarity is not protecting them. Amid accusations and counter-accusations between the government and its critics, it remains unclear exactly what motivated the policemen in the video to simply hand over their weapons to the Taliban without putting up a fight or even showing anger. But there could be many reasons, some of which may have more to do with local rather than national politics. There is the possibility that the pockets of Pashtun settlement in the north are feeling under threat after the presidential elections brought to the fore Abdullah Abdullah, a Tajik leader in close competition with Karzai. The possibility of a non-Pashtun power takeover could be a terrifying prospect for the Pashtun populations there. After all, there are allegations that forces loyal to the Afghan-Uzbek leader General Rashid Dostum killed 2,000 Taliban prisoners of war in 2001. The Obama administration has recently ordered a review of that incident, which allegedly took place soon after the collapse of the Taliban regime. But Dostum's followers have raised objections, correctly saying that singling out Dostum while offering negotiations to the Taliban leader, Mullah Omar, smacks of injustice and hypocrisy. The ordering of the review has done little for inter-ethnic trust in Afghanistan. It is, after all, Dostum's troops who are fighting the Taliban in the north. Anecdotal evidence is also widespread that families are hedging their bets between Kabul and the Taliban by sending one cousin to fight for the Taliban and another to serve the police force. This kith-and-kin interpretation of the meeting seen in the video may have an element of truth to it. After all, keeping one's options open with both – the power in charge and the power that might be – is a known survival strategy dating back to the war in the 1980s. Those who deployed the strategy in the 1980s turned out to be wise. Solid ideological loyalty is a luxury that few can afford in Afghanistan, especially now the international community has offered negotiations with the Taliban. Ultimately, it is the commentary that has surrounded the video that is more revealing than the footage itself. It was always clear that the Taliban were getting their weapons from somewhere, and in an economy so reliant on notionally corrupt transactions as that of Afghanistan, it would be surprising if some policemen were not selling their weapons to Taliban \"enemies\" with whom they may well have grown up. What the video and the discussions around it have revealed, then, is the paranoia of ethnic conspiracy that embroils Afghanistan. And no amount of cracking down on police corruption is likely to put a stop to that."

    "title": "Iran is crippled by conspiracy theories | Henry Newman",
    "content": "This week the Iranian president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, blamed America and Israel for the widespread anti-government protests around Sunday's holy mourning day of Ashura. He insisted that \"Americans and Zionists are the sole audience of a play they have commissioned and sold out\". These allegations echo earlier episodes when Ahmadinejad, his ministers and loyal clerics, have insisted that Britain, Israel and the US are responsible for fomenting the mass protests that have followed June's election-grabbing coup. Iran has formally protested this alleged foreign interference, summoning ambassadors and crying foul. Relations with the west – already tense over the nuclear impasse – have been further strained by arrests of foreign nationals, harassment of embassy employees and the unsavoury record of Iranian involvement in Iraq. Just today this newspaper has published evidence showing that a British hostage captured in Iraq may in fact have been held in Iran by the Revolutionary Guard. This revelation will worsen already deeply strained relations. At one level Ahmadinejad's remarks blaming the west for recent protests seem a crass political attempt to discredit the opposition and to play both on a certain Iranian tradition of xenophobia and on a widespread public memory of repeated foreign power interference historically in Iranian affairs. At another, and more worrying, level they are clearly indicative of an irrational conspiracy theory mentality that permeates Iranian society. An obsession with conspiracy theories is, unsurprisingly perhaps, particularly concentrated among the supporters of a regime now totally lacking legitimacy. Iranian conspiracy theories are above all centred on the British, and an obsession with a pervasive, quasi-omnipotent British power, a siasat-e engelis, dates back at least to the start of the 20th century. This obsession reached the very highest levels: Reza Shah, Iran's first Pahlavi monarch, suspected his own son of working as a British agent. In turn, when that son Muhammad Reza became shah he blamed the British for virtually every international incident, according to the diaries of Asadollah Alam, his confidant and minister of court. Muhammad Reza was even convinced that Muhammad Mosaddeq, leader of the anti-British oil nationalisation movement, was a British employee. Conspiracy theories persist under the republic: lift up Khomeini's beard – so the popular joke goes – and you'll find it stamped \"Made in England\". Years back, a diplomatic friend told me of a meeting in Qom with senior clerics who appealed for Jack Straw to change some aspect or other of Iranian domestic policy, seemingly convinced – despite the diplomat's protestations – that Britain actually had this level of control over domestic Iranian affairs. Others have told me similar stories from ambassadors and other members of Iran's political elite, as well as from the regime's apparatchiks more generally. Other conspiracy theories accuse variously the Americans, European powers, Zionists, Baha'is and freemasons. A ludicrous and nakedly antisemitic news item carried recently by Press TV (essentially a state mouthpiece) accused Israel of kidnapping 25,000 Ukrainian children and bringing them to the occupied territories to harvest their organs. Another episode reinforcing this divorce from reality shared by the conspiracy theorists is the report of Iranian-Canadian journalist Maziar Bahari's interrogation in Evin prison. The story is harrowing indeed but especially given the preposterous insistence (which might in other circumstances be comic) of his interrogator that the journalist was employed simultaneously by four intelligence agencies: the CIA, MI6, Mossad and Newsweek. Of course there is a real and significant history of meddling and interference by foreign states in Iranian affairs. The British legation provided refuge to thousands of anti-government figures during the constitutional revolution, and in the Anglo-Russian convention of 1907 Iran was divided into zones of influence. Later Britain backed the coup that brought Reza Khan to power, so establishing the Pahlavi dynasty, and in 1953 worked with the CIA to mastermind the overthrow of Mosaddeq, the then prime minister, in Operation Ajax, which restored the autocracy of the shah. There were other episodes of foreign interference: some self-serving and pernicious, others with perhaps nobler – albeit often misguided – intentions. Popular memory and the historical narratives propagated by the republic emphasise this foreign involvement. In so doing they deny agency to Iranian society to control its own destiny. Take Operation Ajax. It is certainly true that M16 and the CIA conspired against Mosaddeq. However they were able to exploit a fear of Mosaddeq's reforms that was growing among the conservative mercantile and clerical classes, and to work with royalists already plotting against Mosaddeq. The opposition of several major clerics, notably Ayatollah Kashani, helped cement a wider opposition to Mosaddeq, utilised by American-paid agents provocateurs. Had large elements of the traditionalist middle class not turned against Mosaddeq it is unlikely that the coup would have been successful. Conspiracy theories have been brought back to the foreground by the political crisis of recent months. This crisis should be conceived as a dual problem of deep schisms within the ruling religio-political elite coupled with a broad mass movement challenging the election-grabbing coup of last June alongside a multitude of other grievances. Faced with a massive legitimacy crisis, the Iranian regime and its supporters have been quick to point the finger at foreign powers. While Whitehall and the White House were rightly initially wary of overtly supporting the Iranian opposition for fear of tainting the opposition as foreign lackeys, they were nonetheless branded as such. Many have been arrested, tried and even convicted of espionage and of working as foreign agents. Washington and London have now taken a more critical line: directly challenging the brutal repression and violence used against protesters and opposition figures and their families. Mike Hammer of the White House's national security council stated recently that America stands behind those \"who peacefully seek their universal rights\". Ahmadinejad's insistence in blaming the unrest on foreign powers is not simply disingenuous; he may well genuinely believe his assertions. Many are convinced that a \"British establishment\" is working to overthrow Iran's political system and that it co-ordinates organisations as varied as the BBC, the Guardian, the Palace of Westminster, the British Museum (with its Shah Abbas exhibition supposedly intended to reinforce Sunni/Shia divides), and the Queen's College at the University of Oxford (which established a scholarship in memory of Neda Agha-Soltan). Iranian society is certainly not unique in favouring conspiracy theories. However, in Iran these ideas reach the highest level of the ruling classes with horrific consequences. In engaging with Iran and its leadership the international community should be mindful of this conspiracy mentality. They must be transparent and candid in their dealings with Iran. They should be open in their opposition to Iran's violence against peaceful protest which patently contravenes treaties including the UN international covenant on civil and political rights of which Iran is a signatory. Above all though, the international community must insist that the Iranian people alone have the ability and legitimacy to determine their political destiny, whatever they choose it to be."

    "title": "Letters: Evolution of the Darwin conspiracy",
    "content": "This year we have been celebrating Charles Darwin and his Origin of Species. Sadly, little has been heard of Alfred Wallace, who, according to a recent book by Roy Davies (The Darwin Conspiracy), has a stronger claim to the theory of evolution by natural selection than has Darwin. In 1855, Wallace's first paper on evolution prompted Charles Lyell to warn Darwin that Wallace seemed close to solving the \"species problem\" and to urge him to publish his own theory. Three years later, while studying the fauna of the Malayan archipelago, Wallace completed his theory and sent it to Darwin from the island of Ternate on 9 March 1858. Sent to England on the same boat was a letter to Frederick Bates, who received it on 3 June. It seems that Darwin wrote to Joseph Hooker on 8 June, saying he had found the \"missing keystone\" that enabled the completion of his evolution theory, while on 18 June, he wrote that he had just received a letter from Wallace proposing a theory of evolution identical to his own – a very suspicious chronology! Although it initially became known as the Darwin-Wallace theory, Darwin took the glory and Wallace was largely forgotten. Lacking Darwin's establishment connections, Wallace was shabbily treated and should be recognised as at least an equal in the Wallace-Darwin theory of evolution. Dr Alfred Venables, Professor Julian Wimpenny, Professor David Lloyd Cardiff • Alastair Noble (Response, 1 December) proposes the invention of an original entity possessing \"intelligence\", but the mystery is merely moved one stage further away. Logic requires there must be a super-intelligent designer who crafted our designer, and so on. This argument is clearly futile. Let us all accept that the theory of evolution is the best we can hope for now, and expect it to be refined as human knowledge expands. Robin Keable Shoeburyness, Essex"

    "title": "The absurd Megrahi conspiracy theorists | Martin Kettle",
    "content": "It would be wrong to say that the British domestic argument about Abdelbaset Ali al-Megrahi's release has become a Seinfeld – a row about nothing. But it is moving rapidly in that direction. Much of the partisan response and a lot of the media commentary on the case in the wake of the release of the Megrahi documentation on Tuesday has become almost as absurd as an argument about angels on pinheads. The disproportion between the issue and the coverage would be funny if the case to which it ultimately relates were not so tragic. This applies, in spades and in particular, to the so-called revelation that the British government \"did not want Megrahi to die in prison\". Please, can someone enlighten me about what bit of this supposedly shocking discovery is either surprising or discreditable? Yes, it would indeed be shocking – depending on how easily you are shocked – if Gordon Brown had said to Colonel Gaddafi that he wanted to have Megrahi released as soon as possible. Yes, it would be discreditable if the then foreign office minister Bill Rammell had told his Libyan counterpart that Britain would spring Megrahi from his Scottish prison as proof that a new chapter was opening in UK relations with his country. But here's the point. Neither of them, as far as we know and judging from the evidence, said anything remotely like that. What they said – and I admit that I am paraphrasing here – was that while they accepted that Megrahi's imprisonment for the Lockerbie bombing was undoubtedly a barrier to an all-singing all-dancing special UK-Libyan relationship, and while it would indisputably be an easier relationship if the issue could somehow be taken off the table, the facts were that it was very much on the table and there was not in practice a great deal that UK ministers could do about it except make understanding but noncommittal noises in private. The principal reason for that, and here the documents are clear over and over again, is that Megrahi's release was acknowledged at all times as a matter for the sovereign Scottish legal system under which he had originally been convicted. That fact is repeatedly underlined in the correspondence that was released yesterday. Every one of Jack Straw's letters mentions the point. They mention it because it is true. Whatever other considerations ministers might wish to apply in the Megrahi case, they are all trumped by the law and the rules. A lot of the confected outrage in the media simply ignores the stubborn reality that ministers accepted that their hands were tied. We can judge, of course, that in UK ministerial eyes the Scottish dimension is not merely a constitutional barrier but also, unacknowledged in the documents, a political one too. Only a fool would dispute that dimension. With a hostile SNP administration in power in Holyrood, any suggestion that Labour in London might be trying to put pressure on the Nats in Edinburgh to release a mass murderer of innocent Scots (and innocent passengers of course) into the hands of an Arab tyrant in return for oil contracts would not merely be a presentational problem at home and abroad but a political hospital pass of epic dimensions. Nothing would have delighted Alex Salmond and Kenny MacAskill more than to be able to denounce the Labour government's venal approach to the Megrahi release. That's one, but not the only, reason why it has not happened. And let's also, while we are on the subject of the release, have a little respect for words and what they mean. British ministers did not wish Megrahi to die in prison, and told the Libyans so. That is not the same thing as saying they wanted him to be released prematurely, or were willing for him to be flown home to Libya, let alone were prepared to turn the other cheek while he was treated like a returning national hero. And, guess what, no minister has said anything remotely consistent with any of those possibilities. There is a lot of difference between, on the one hand, allowing a life sentence prisoner to be taken by ambulance while still formally in custody to die in a local hospital where his final hours can be reasonably dignified, his relatives can come and go and have time with him, and his religious and cultural needs can be respected and, on the other, formally releasing him to walk out of his cell, be driven to the airport, to walk unaided up the aircraft steps in full view of the world's media, to return to a hero's welcome and to be able to conduct interviews with politicians and media organisations, even though he is suffering from terminal cancer. Not wanting Megrahi to die in prison is not the same as countenancing any of the things that actually happened. If it is all so straightforward, then why has Labour not been more honest about it? Why has Brown evaded the issue? Why did David Miliband sound so defensive about it on the Today programme this morning? I can think of three main reasons. The first is that ministers do not want to compound the domestic or international damage of the Megrahi mess by telling the truth, even in more measured and statesmanlike terms than I have used. When in a hole, in other words, stop digging, especially when, to mix metaphors, it is any-stick-to-beat-a-dog time for the political class and the Labour government. The second possibility, related to the first, is that Brown, in particular, is congenitally averse to taking flak over things that have gone wrong, especially when his entire brain is focused on controlling the domestic party political agenda on his own terms in the approach to a general election. This is often described as his Macavity instinct of evading responsibility, which it partly is, but it is also, in his own head, a matter of controlling the agenda. Rightly or wrongly he thinks he is not in politics to do whatever the media or David Cameron want him to do. Disapprove of his leadership though I do, I can only agree with him on that one. The third possibility is that I am seriously wrong and that the government really does have dirty secrets to hide about this affair, which it is frightened may come out. Perhaps Brown and Miliband really did tell the Libyans they would do everything they could to get Megrahi back to Tripoli this summer in return for oil contracts that Gaddafi's son was drawing up in Corfu with Peter Mandelson, while simultaneously telling the Americans that they were fighting off Salmond's cravenly compassionate administration's wish to release Megrahi to die in the desert with his god. Or something like that. On the whole, though, I prefer to stick to the evidence, even though it is much less exciting."

    "content": "A former Olympic judo competitor who once allegedly tortured a man by forcing his hands into a toaster was today found guilty of being part of a gang that turned over almost £1m a week selling cocaine and ecstasy. The jury was told that police stumbled on a drugs factory at James Waithe's flat in Bristol after being called to investigate a suspected burglary. Officers were shocked to find a 10-tonne hydraulic press, white powder and cutting agents, as well as rifles, handguns and stun grenades. Waithe, 47, a teacher who represented Barbados at the 1988 Seoul Olympics and England in the Commonwealth games, said he owned the flat but did not live there and had nothing to do with the racket. He was convicted of conspiracy to supply cocaine but was found not guilty of conspiracy to possess an explosive substance. The jury at Bristol crown court has still to reach a verdict on other counts of possession of a firearm. Waithe, who was said to be the gang's enforcer, taught PE and citizenship at Withywood community school and Bristol Gateway special school. He was also a coach at a judo club. Stephen Mooney, prosecuting, told the jury the operation was on an \"industrial scale\" and worth millions. Mooney said Waithe's claim that he did not live at the flat was undermined when police found a judo suit in the washing machine as well as awards and documents relating to him. The court heard details of his alleged violence, including that he had once held a man's hands in a hot electric toaster. Robert Brooks, 63, of no fixed address, was found not guilty of six firearms charges but guilty of conspiracy to possess explosives and conspiracy to supply drugs. Grant Richmond, 29, Craig Rodel, 46, and Luke Downes, 22, all of Bristol, all admitted conspiracy to supply drugs."

    "title": "Man charged with conspiracy in US terrorism investigation",
    "content": "A young Afghan immigrant, Najibullah Zazi, has been charged with conspiracy to use weapons of mass destruction in what investigators suspect was a plot to bomb New York's transport system. According to the indictment against Zazi issued today, the 24-year-old airport bus driver spent the past year plotting the attacks but in the past fortnight began \"urgently\" looking for help to manufacture explosives and had recently bought bomb-making supplies from beauty stores. He is also alleged to have obtained instructions on how to make explosives and made notes on them that included the specifications for the bombs used in the 2005 attacks on the London Underground and the attempt by the alleged \"shoe bomber\", Richard Reid, to blow up a transatlantic flight. Zazi, who had lived in the US for 10 years, has denied the accusations. He faces up to life in prison if convicted. According to court papers, Zazi \"and others\" travelled to Pakistan a year ago. \"Zazi received detailed bomb-making instructions in Pakistan, purchased components of improvised explosive devices, and travelled to New York on 10 September 2009 in furtherance of his criminal plans,\" court papers say. On returning from Pakistan earlier this year, Zazi moved to Colorado where he is alleged to have rented a hotel suite this month and used the kitchen to attempt to mix explosives. FBI tests found residue of bomb-making ingredients in the vent above the stove but searches of several properties have not turned up any explosives. Zazi and unnamed associates are alleged to have bought unusually large amounts of hydrogen peroxide and acetone products from beauty supply stores around Denver over several weeks. The papers also say that Zazi searched the internet for home improvement stores in Queens, a New York borough, and then looked to see if the store stocked another explosive component, muriatic acid. Shortly afterwards, Zazi rented a car and drove to the city. Bomb-making notes were also found on the accused man's laptop in the car, according to the court document, including information about heating bomb components to make them highly concentrated. The court papers say that on 6 and 7 September, Zazi attempted to communicate with another person \"seeking to correct mixtures of ingredients to make explosives\". \"Each communication,\" the papers say, was \"more urgent than the last.\" The court papers do not specify the targets Zazi is alleged to have planned to attack but the US press has reported FBI agents as saying they believe that the New York subway train system was a likely target. They say the discovery of backpacks and mobile phones suggest that Zazi was planning an attack similar to the bombings of the London Underground and trains in Madrid. Zazi was originally arrested in Denver with his father, Mohammed, 53, and a New York City imam, Ahmad Wais Afzali, on charges of lying to federal anti-terrorism investigators about bomb-making literature. The New York Times reported today that investigators were forced to move against Zazi earlier than they had wished after a second anti-terrorist force indirectly tipped him off that he was being monitored by approaching the imam for assistance. The arrests were followed by warnings of possible attacks on transit, sports and entertainment complexes. In a memorandum prosecutors filed in court seeking to deny Zazi bail they say that he was intent to the last on carrying out an attack. \"The evidence at trial will show that Zazi remained committed to detonating an explosive device up until the date of his arrest,\" the prosecutors say. The US attorney general, Eric Holder, said today that \"any imminent threat\" from the plot has \"been disrupted\". \"We are investigating a wide range of leads related to this alleged conspiracy, and we will continue to work around the clock to ensure that anyone involved is brought to justice,\" Holder said. \"We believe any imminent threat arising from this case has been disrupted, but as always, we remind the American public to be vigilant and to report any suspicious activity to law enforcement.\""

    "title": "US troop surge met in Afghanistan with cynicism and conspiracy theories",
    "content": "Despite Barack Obama's face featuring prominently on the evening bulletins on the various televisions positioned around one of central Kabul's large and grimy restaurants, tonight few of the diners were taking any notice of the news that an extra 30,000 US troops would be arriving in Afghanistan soon. \"It is just a political decision taken by the Americans, it has nothing to do with us,\" said one customer. Those watching were sceptical about the chances of the surge bringing peace. \"Wherever the foreign forces go they are attacked and it is the civilians who always get killed,\" said Mohamad Ashraf, an economics graduate, as he tucked into a dinner of fried mutton. \"Nato already has thousands of troops, far more than the Taliban, but they have been unable to stop districts coming under their control,\" said Ashraf, arguing that such success could only be explained by some sort of clandestine US support for the insurgency. It is not hard to find conspiracy theories amid widespread disillusionment among people who have witnessed the steady deterioration of security conditions in the country since 2001. \"In 2001 and 2002 there were no explosions or suicide attacks; it was only when the foreign troops came that the situation got worse,\" said Ali Khan, a cobbler in Lashkar Gah in Helmand. A businessman who imports clothes from Pakistan and is able to freely move around areas with an enormous Taliban influence, he warned that no amount of troops would help in the south. \"Even if it is 90,000 they won't be able to do anything; [the Taliban's] power is too much,\" he said. Despite the low esteem Nato is held in, there were few prepared to say foreign troops should leave. \"They cannot leave until Afghanistan is strong enough to look after itself, otherwise we will return to the factional fighting of the 1990s,\" said Noorullah Khan, a policeman. Many more agreed with Obama and General Stanley McChrystal's main idea that the country's own security forces should be massively increased. \"When [the army and police are] strengthened and administrative problems of corruption have been removed then they will be able to defend Afghanistan much better than the Americans,\" said Haji Agha Lalai, a former head of a peace and reconciliation committee in Kandahar. But he warned the US against rushing training in the hurry to reduce troop numbers. \"Trying to do anything in 18 months certainly won't work.\" Obama's call for US troops to begin to come home in a year and a half has alarmed some Afghans, fearful that they will again be abandoned as they were in the 90s after the Soviet withdrawal. But Mohamad Ehsa, an 18-year-old minding his father's grocery shop, said he believed the Americans when they said a withdrawal would only occur when conditions had been met. \"They will not leave until Afghanistan is strong and it is safe for them to go. I don't think they would want to see the country fall back into war again,\" he said."

    "title": "Climatologist at centre of leaked email row dismisses conspiracy claims",
    "content": "The climatologist at the centre of the leaked emails row said today that he \"absolutely\" stands by his research and that any suggestion that the emails provide evidence of a conspiracy to manipulate or hide data that do not support the theory of man-made climate change was \"complete rubbish\". Professor Phil Jones, director of the University of East Anglia's Climate Research Unit, said that the past week had been \"the worst few days of my professional life\". He added that since the emails were leaked he had received personal threats which have now been passed on to the police to investigate. In his first full interview since last week's theft, which saw hundreds of emails and documents exchanged between some of the leading climatologists over the past 13 years stolen from the university's servers, Jones defended himself against accusations by climate sceptics that the emails provide evidence of collusion by climatologists to fix data. \"That the world is warming is based on a range of sources: not only temperature records but other indicators such as sea level rise, glacier retreat and less Arctic sea ice,\" he said. \"Our global temperature series tallies with those of other, completely independent, groups of scientists working for Nasa and the National Climate Data Centre in the United States, among others. Even if you were to ignore our findings, theirs show the same results. The facts speak for themselves; there is no need for anyone to manipulate them.\" Jones accepted, though, that the contents of some of the emails were cause for embarrassment: \"Some of the emails probably had poorly chosen words and were sent in the heat of the moment, when I was frustrated. I do regret sending some of them. We've not deleted any emails or data here at CRU. I would never manipulate the data one bit - I would categorically deny that.\" He confirmed that all of the leaked emails that had provoked heated debate – including the now infamous email from 1999 in which he discussed a \"trick\" to \"hide the decline\" in global temperatures - appeared to be genuine. \"The use of the term 'hiding the decline' was in an email written in haste,\" he said. \"CRU has not sought to hide the decline.\" (The University of East Anglia has now posted a detailed explanation of why this phrase was used on its website) Jones said the timing of the theft suggested it was intended to cause maximum embarrassment ahead of the Copenhagen climate talks next month: \"One has to wonder if it is a coincidence that this email correspondence has been stolen and published at this time. This may be a concerted attempt to put a question mark over the science of climate change in the run-up to the Copenhagen talks.\" But he stressed that he has never wished to get drawn into the political debate about climate change, saying: \"I'm a very apolitical person, I don't want to get involved in the politics, I'm much happier doing the science and producing the papers. I'm a scientist, I let my science do the talking, along with all my scientific climate colleagues. It's up to governments to decide and climate science is just one thing they have to take into account with the decisions they have to make.\" He added that he had long been under pressure from climate sceptics to further explain his research: \"From about 2001/2002 I was getting emails from a number of people involved in the climate sceptic community. Initially at the beginning I did try to respond to them in the hope I might convince them but I soon realised it was a forlorn hope and broke off communication. Some of the emails I sent them subsequently appeared and were discussed on various sceptic websites.\" Trevor Davies, the University of East Anglia's pro-vice-chancellor with responsibility for research, rejected calls – including from the Guardian commentator George Monbiot – for Jones to resign: \"We see no reason for Professor Jones to resign and, indeed, we would not accept his resignation. He is a valued and important scientist.\" Davies said the university had now decided to conduct an independent review which will \"address the issue of data security, an assessment of how we responded to a deluge of Freedom of Information requests, and any other relevant issues which the independent reviewer advises should be addressed\". Yesterday, prominent members of both sides of the climate change debate, including the climate change sceptic Lord Lawson, had called for an independent review. Lawson said he believed this should be carried out by the Natural Environment Research Council, a government science funding body. But a spokesperson for Nerc said it was not a matter for them. \"Nerc believes this is a matter for the University of East Anglia - their Climatic Research Unit is not a Nerc unit - so it is for them to decide if they call for an enquiry and if so who should conduct it. Should there be an enquiry we would of course be happy to contribute, if asked.\" A spokesperson for the journal Nature said, \"In line with our standard policy, if clear evidence were to arise that anything we've published is in question then we'll look into any action that may need to be taken.\""

    "title": "Conspiracy theory top 10",
    "content": "A couple of years ago a Guardian colleague told me a piece I had co-written on the terrorist attack on the World Trade Centre had been cited as evidence by conspiracy theorists that 9/11 was really a CIA plot. To be honest I was rather tickled that the makers of the infamous \"documentary\" Loose Change had - however ridiculously - come to this conclusion. So I'm rather disappointed to discover I'm only implicated in the UK's second most widely believed conspiracy theory. Yes, it would seem that more people (48% of 1,000 British adults interviewed) actually believe Area 51 exists to investigate aliens than the claim that the Twin Towers were brought down by a controlled demolition (a mere 38%). Though that result may have something to do with the survey being carried out by 20th Century Fox as part of its marketing campaign for the new X-Files film, I Want To Believe. That more than half of those interviewed also believe in aliens and telepathy makes me wonder if the poll wasn't conducted at a sci-fi convention. It's a conspiracy, I tell you ... It's no surprise to find the top 10 conspiracy theories also includes the belief that the moon landings were faked (a conspiracy that inspired the film Capricorn One) or that Diana and Dodi were murdered. And no list of conspiracy theories would be complete without the bizzare idea that the world is secretly governed by a cabal of shape-shifting dinosaurs - coming in at number 10, with 3%. Indeed, David Icke reckons this cartoon is evidence that our reptilian masters walk among us. I'm a little disappointed that more people don't believe that Smurfs are a Hindu conspiracy to prepare kids for the coming of Krishna by introducing them to blue people - an urban legend popularised by the film Slacker. Or that the soft drink Fanta was invented by the Nazis. Then of course there's the ultimate conspiracy - that Charlie Brooker was invented by MI5 to round up every conspiracy nut on the internet."

Obama hosted a sleepover! -- it's only surprising that a story on the nominees' left-handedness has taken this long to emerge. But indeed it has emerged, with one psychology professor proclaiming that McCain and Obama's shared southpaw status is \"not an accident\". Only 10% of Americans are left-handed, yet four of the last six presidents have had the unusual alignment. Does the data mean that left-handed politicians are best-equipped to win elections? Lefties are known as more creative and quirky; are these truly the attributes Americans seek in their leaders? Or maybe this is the question, given that only two presidents before 1974 were known lefties: did the Watergate scandal unleash an insidious epidemic in the US that has slowly driven us away from intellectual curiosity and convinced us to put blind faith in the diminished office of the president? Nah, can't be. Hey, I wonder if Obama and McCain shop at Ned Flanders' Leftorium!"

    "title": "Nick Herbert: Abolishing prison won't stop crime",
    "content": "Last week saw an International Conference on Penal Abolition. With such a heady ambition, what can be next? A global conference to abolish crime? The ambition of an eccentric minority to abolish prison isn't just dotty. It's a distraction from a real and pressing agenda, which is to reform prisons which simply aren't working. A century ago, prisons had hard labour and treadmills. Today, they have colour TVs in cells. Jails may have changed, but the enduring truth that they are necessary has not. We will always have a small minority of offenders who, by their behaviour, pose so great a threat to the lives and property of the law-abiding majority that they must be kept apart from us. Ignoring this reality and arguing for the total abolition of prison is a hopelessly utopian goal that does the credibility of penal reformers no service. The case for penal abolition rests on a series of tenuous assertions. Let's set aside the obvious, if uncomfortable, fact that part of the purpose of prison is to punish. It's said that short-term prison sentences don't work, because recidivism rates are shockingly high and there is little time for any restorative programmes to work. But since the evidence is that longer sentences have lower recidivism rates, and provide the opportunity to rehabilitate offenders, this might be an argument to lengthen sentences, not abolish them altogether. After all, another purpose of prison is to incapacitate offenders. Of course, overcrowded prisons that are awash with drugs, and a system which gives short-term prisoners no supervision or support on release, is almost calculated to fail. But this could equally be an argument – the one which the modern Conservative party is making – for a complete transformation of prison regimes and a system of support for offenders when they are released from jail. It's a logical non sequitur on a grand scale to argue that because short-term prison sentences currently aren't working, we should therefore stop using them at all. Abolitionists say that short-term prison sentences have a poorer recidivism rate than community sentences. In fact, both have a lamentable record – and one that has deteriorated in the last ten years. But the difference is hardly surprising, since the worst recidivists are bound to end up in jail. According to Home Office figures (pdf), only 12% of those sentenced to prison have no previous convictions. Over half have five or more previous convictions, and over a third have ten or more. Those who say that prison should be reserved for serious or serial offenders tend to ignore the fact that it already is. Serial offenders who end up with custodial sentences have usually run through the gamut of weak community sentences already. If we want to avoid magistrates having little choice but to send them down, the logical thing to do is to make community sentences far more effective. Yet the perverse reaction of the abolitionists is to recommend that the very community disposals that have, by definition, already failed are used again. Over a third of unpaid work requirements are not completed. Drug rehabilitation requirements have an even worse record – fewer than half are completed. If a fraction of the energy and resources that are being devoted to the cause of penal abolition were directed to thinking seriously about how better to design non-custodial punishments, short-term prison sentences would be less necessary. What do the abolitionists really want? If it's the end of all custody, including for the most serious and dangerous offenders, then we can dismiss their demands as truly silly. If it's the abolition of short-term custodial sentences, then the effect on the overall prison population will be minimal. Justice ministry tables show (pdf) that over 87% of the current prison population are serving sentences of over 12 months. Abolishing prison for those serving, say, six months or less would mean watering down 60,000 sentences – but it would reduce the prison population by less than 7,000. The more effective and sustainable way to reduce the prison population in the long term is to reduce re-offending, as the Conservative party's radical \"rehabilitation revolution\" proposes. It would be nice to live in a society where there were no prisons, just as it would be nice if there were no hospitals because there was no illness. But until someone steps forward with a ten-year plan to Make Crime History, jails are here to stay. The challenge is to create prisons with a purpose – not to hold lazy conferences making futile calls for their abolition."

    "title": "Steve Fossett conspiracy theories get a reboot",
    "content": "As search teams busied themselves combing the rugged Californian mountains for more evidence after a hiker's discovery of two identification cards and a wad of cash, bloggers got on with things this morning on the web. There already exists quite a comprehensive body of material of the possibilities other than a straight forward plane crash to answer the unanswerable in the Fossett mystery. One of the favourites, is that the adventurer was shot down over Area 51. Also the story about how a Californian highway patrol officer actually saw the plane flying low near Mammoth lakes and has subsequently vanished. Oh, and let's not forget the possibility that he was kidnapped by Islamic terrorists, because that also makes it into e bloggers list of 12 possibilities, which you can read here. On the slightly more-believable level, there is much discussion that Fossett could have faked his own death following some ill-advised business ventures, or so he could start a new life with one or other of his supposed mistresses, and that he had been squirreling money away into a secret bank account for some time. We can blame the British press - in some capacity - for the beginnings of the conspiracy theories, which, when tracing the trail back, appear to have started in the News of the World and been carried in the Daily Telegraph. It published a story quoting Lieutenant Colonel Cynthia Ryan of the US civil air patrol who said Fossett may have faked his own death because of personal problems or fears about his business dealings. I've been doing this search and rescue for 14 years. Fossett should have been found. It's not like we didn't have our eyes open. We found six other planes while we were looking for him. We're pretty good at what we do. Then there was the risk assessor Robert Davis, who carried out an eight-month investigation into Fossett's death. I discovered that there is absolutely no proof that Steve Fossett is actually dead. I'm not a conspiracy theorist, I'm a man who deals in facts, and I don't really care if he is alive or dead, it makes no difference to me. What I am interested in is the truth - and a proper criminal investigation of this man's disappearance was never undertaken by law enforcement or officials in the state of Nevada. This was followed by an all-encompassing piece in the Independent, which made an interesting point about the military personnel who had helped propagate the theories. Military people are not prone to hyperbole, and Ryan's comments about the Fossett case (in an interview with the News of the World last weekend) were far from understated. Perhaps the last word, then, to a blogger who claims to be a ''fellow billionaire and acquaintance\" of Fossett's, who had this to say today: You see, in the search for Fossett, every form of technology known (some unknown) to man has been employed in the search effort: satellites, radar, aerial, foot, dogs, microwave, internet, seismic, thermal scans, .... and thousands upon thousands of personnel have been involved. BUT NO FOSSETT! I can't help but wonder, \"is something else going on here?\" There has never ever been this level of technology and manpower put into a search for anyone in history, still zilch! I'm no conspiracy theorist, but, you have to admit this is interesting…"

    "title": "Jack Shenker: Egypt is ablaze with conspiracy theories",
    "content": "As fires go, this one was as farcical as it was spectacular. Egypt's Shura council building, a magnificent 19th century palace now home to the upper house of parliament, stood engulfed in flames, belching thick black smoke over downtown Cairo as helicopters ferried buckets from the Nile. Firefighters at the site were paralysed by a lack of water, only to be drenched from above as the choppers missed their target. The thousands of Egyptians who had thronged into sidestreets to witness one of the country's most venerable political institutions descend into a raging inferno were highly amused. \"I'm just sorry parliament wasn't in session,\" remarked one bystander. A week on and the embers have finally died down, but Cairo remains ablaze with conspiracy theories about the fire and an explosive cynicism about the government's role in the events. The majority of Egypt's citizens have long been scornful of their pseudo-democratic institutions, which are generally viewed as toothless rubber-stamps for the autocratic presidency of Hosni Mubarak, an American-backed \"ally\" of the west who has become one of the Arab world's longest-serving rulers. But the destruction of the Shura council building, which played host to the famous trial of nationalist hero Ahmed Orabi in 1881 and the signing of Egypt's first constitution in 1923, has galvanised the country's growing opposition movement and left Mubarak's regime on the defensive. Question marks over the official version of events – the government initially claimed that an electrical short circuit sparked the blaze – began to emerge even while the council still smouldered. By the next morning, controversial claims were flowing thick and fast into independent media outlets and the blogosphere: no proper fire-protection system was installed in the building; fire trucks permanently stationed within five minutes of the site allegedly took two-and-a-half hours to begin tackling the blaze; a group of engineering workers in the council ran upstairs with fire extinguishers when the fire first broke out only to find their way mysteriously blocked by state security officials. The most incendiary allegations were splashed on the front page of the left-leaning daily newspaper al-Badeel, which linked these strange occurrences with the destruction of the building's parliamentary archive. Among the papers reduced to ashes by the fire were documents relating to high-profile and ongoing corruption cases against business figures with close links to the president. The state-owned printing presses were ordered not to print al-Badeel and the newspaper never made it on to the street, although pdfs of the banned edition soon spilled on to the web. One of the highest-ranking former members of the state security apparatus – General Fouad Alam, who now works as a counter-terrorism expert – soon fanned the flames by observing that the cause must have been arson, contradicting the establishment line. Every possible other motive has spread around the city's network of loquacious taxi-drivers, with some claiming the government wanted to sell off the council's land to developers (impossible before the fire as the building was listed as an historic monument by the Supreme Council of Antiquities) and others insisting the fire was meant to distract from the resignation of another unpopular dictator, the Pakistani president, Pervez Musharraf. \"Hosni asked his aides, 'Which authority in Pakistan endorsed Musharraf's resignation?'\" runs a joke currently doing the rounds. \"They replied, 'The parliament.' Mubarak shouted, 'Burn ours down.'\" Claims that the parliament was destroyed as part of a valuable land-grab are believed because the government has spent the last decade selling off so many national assets in scandal-ridden privatisation deals. Using the fire as a distraction from Musharraf also seems a plausible strategy for a leader who continues to keep his one-time presidential opponent Ayman Nour locked up in jail on trumped up forgery charges. But it is the tale of the incinerated corruption files that has gained the most traction, largely because corruption has been a particularly hot topic in Egypt ever since the courts' decision earlier this month to acquit Mamduh Ismail, a ferry operator with strong ties to the Mubarak regime, of any responsibility for the sinking of one of his boats six years ago, in which more than a thousand Egyptians drowned. The decision produced a wave of popular outrage at a time when the government is facing a huge increase in strikes and protests over the rising cost of living and the failure of political reform. \"There is a different, more radical mood in the country today,\" observed Hamdi Qenawi, an activist speaking at a recent meeting of tax collectors who are trying to form an independent trade union. \"Fear from the regime is much less than it used to be.\" For Yaser al-Zayat, managing editor of al-Badeel, the importance of the fire lies not in the truth or falsehood of the conspiracies, but in the insight they offer into the nature of the Egyptian government's relationship with its people: \"The regime is getting weaker. That's why the government is resorting to indirect censorship.\" If nothing else, last week's blaze should be a wake-up call to the west of just how volatile this nation has become under Mubarak's stifling rule."

    "title": "Shannon's mother sobs as she denies involvement in kidnap conspiracy",
    "content": "The mother of Shannon Matthews broke down in tears yesterday after accusing her \"violent and abusive\" partner and his family of trying to frame her for the kidnap of her own daughter. Karen Matthews' trial was adjourned to allow her to recover after an hour of gulping and choking back sobs, as she claimed she was told to take the blame for the failed plot - to claim a £50,000 reward for finding the schoolgirl - because she was a woman without convictions who \"would get off lightly\". More than 50 times in two hours she denied involvement in the kidnap, after walking the few yards to the witness box from the dock at Leeds crown court where she has sat silently for a fortnight. She repeatedly answered \"I did not\" and \"no\" as barristers asked her about alleged bullying, threats and lies surrounding the nine-year-old's disappearance from her home in Dewsbury, West Yorkshire, for 24 days in February and March. Matthews said she was scared, upset and disgusted to be linked to the scam, which saw her daughter drugged with travel sickness pills and kept in a flat, with a leash as a restraint when she was left alone. Shannon was finally found by police in a drawer under a bed. The flat's owner, Michael Donovan, the 40-year-old uncle of Matthews' partner, Craig Meehan, was also hiding in the drawer. Matthews, 33, and Donovan deny kidnap, false imprisonment and perverting the course of justice by triggering a £3.2m police search and standing silently by when they knew where the child was. The jury of seven women and five men has been told that the scam was designed to end once the reward topped £50,000, with Donovan releasing Shannon and then \"finding\" her in Dewsbury market. Between sobs and pauses, Matthews turned on Donovan, who sat next to a security officer in the dock staring at the floor. She said she hardly knew him, had never visited his flat in Batley, less than two miles from her own home, and had no idea that Shannon was hidden there. \"I'm just disgusted because I haven't had nothing to do with it,\" she told her QC, Frances Oldham, who took her through a series of claims and different stories given to West Yorkshire police. Frequently asked to speak up, and offered tissues by Mr Justice McCombe, she blamed Meehan for getting her arrested. \"I was scared of him. He was violent,\" she said. \"Seven days before Shannon disappeared, he punched my arm and hit me in the face - slapped me. He told me if I left him he would tell people I was an unfit mother and have my children taken away from me.\" Oldham asked if Meehan had said anything about what Matthews should say or do after Shannon had been found. After a pause, Matthews said, only just audibly: \"For me to take the blame for Shannon.\" Oldham asked: \"Did he say why?\" Matthews replied: \"I had no convictions and I was female and I'd get off lightly.\" She said Meehan had hatched the \"hush hush\" plot with his sister Amanda Hyett, who lived next door to the family, and Donovan. \"I have thought about what has happened and I believe the three of them hatched the plan to keep me in the dark,\" she said. Shortly afterwards she broke down completely and the jury was sent out for 10 minutes. Before Matthews took the stand, Oldham accused the police and media of jumping to conclusions about the case and warned jurors not to do the same. She told them: \"Karen Matthews has been demonised in the media and you could be forgiven for expecting the worst from her. \"It would be easy to approach her evidence on the basis she's a liar. But you have only heard half of the case so far. You 12 have the opportunity of considering, not just smear, not just injustice, not just prejudice, but the evidence here.\" Matthews began her long list of denials by dismissing suggestions from Donovan, who gave evidence earlier this week, that she had threatened to have him killed or his car torched by \"lads\" she knew, if he refused to hide Shannon in his flat. Cross-examined by Alan Conrad QC, for Donovan, she denied she was a \"hard, manipulative woman who saw Donovan as someone to take advantage of and bully\". The court was played part of Matthews' 999 call to police, four hours after Shannon failed to return home from a school swimming trip. Her tearful TV appeal the next day, saying \"Shannon, please come home, we love to you to bits\" was also shown. Conrad accused her of accomplished lying, both in the film and the dock. \"You're putting on a staged performance for the jury today, are you not? Just as it was a staged performance during the three and a half weeks your daughter was missing. You can play for the cameras and play for the court, can't you?\" Matthews replied \"no\" and denied that she had practised both her answers and her tears beforehand. \"I love my children. I never, ever knew where my daughter was and I've said that all along because it's true,\" she said. \"I've always said that I didn't have nothing to do with it.\" She told Oldham that her different stories at different times during the police inquiry had been prompted by fears that all four of her children, aged between 12 and three, would \"be tooken off me\". Since her arrest in March, all four have been looked after in care. Conrad asked her: \"Isn't it the position that when you're in a difficulty you'll just accuse anybody else?\" Matthews denied that: \"I was overwhelmed when Shannon was found safe and well. I was just happy that she was found.\" The trial continues. Transcript: 'I never knew where she was' Frances Oldham QC, representing Karen Matthews: Did you plan the kidnap of your daughter? Karen Matthews: I did not. Oldham: Did you threaten to have Michael Donovan beaten or killed, or his car burned out? Matthews: I did not. Oldham: Did you know Shannon was at Lidgate Gardens with Michael Donovan? Matthews: I did not. Oldham: Did you plan Shannon's kidnap so the media would offer £50,000? Matthews: I did not. Alan Conrad QC, for Donovan, cross-examining Matthews: You saw him as someone to take advantage of and bully. Matthews: No. Conrad: You're putting on, for the jury today, a staged performance. Just as it was a staged performance during the three and a half weeks your daughter was missing. You can play for the cameras and play for the court, can't you? Matthews: No. Conrad: \"If you're right, you've been the victim of a terrible injustice, haven't you? You're just a loving mother who's done nothing wrong? Matthews: I love my children. I never, ever knew where my daughter was and I've said that all along because it's true. I've always said that I didn't have nothing to do with it. Conrad: During the time Shannon was missing, and after that for some considerable time, you were living a lie, weren't you? And you are, to use the prosecution's phrase, an accomplished liar, aren't you? Matthews: No."

The public is not happy with the sky-high cost of a tank of petrol and anybody responsible for ratcheting up prices is considered worthy of a good kicking. People are willing to vent their fury on anybody – even on a mild-mannered bunch of regulatory bureaucrats. The Federal Trade Commission has asked for views on proposed fines of up to $1m per day for anybody caught manipulating the market for oil, gas or other petrochemical products. Responses from the public, which are posted on the commission's website, are illuminating. \"It just boggles my mind how the US government can sit back and let us be effectively raped at the pumps,\" thunders a West Virginia man, Jeremy Bradley. \"How long is this going to be permitted to continue? These leeches are nothing more than a cancer to society.\" Joel Poston of Tennessee is similarly vitriolic: \"FTC get off your ass and stop sitting there collecting taxpayer dollars and not doing your job. Do it today. Impress us all and cause prices to go back to normal.\" A Florida respondent, Brook Paschkes, has a constructive suggestion – why, she asks, doesn't the government give everybody incentives to install solar panels? Meanwhile in Kansas, Gary Reinecke suspects routine price-fixing: \"Here in Wichita, when gas prices go up over night all stations go up in price over night, and they say they don't talk to each other.\" The Independent Lubricant Manufacturers' Association is very much in favour of a clampdown on manipulation – and even wants a broadening of the proposed law. But the oil industry (surprise, surprise) is opposed. The National Petrochemical & Refiners Association, which numbers BP and ExxonMobil among its members, reckons a crackdown on manipulation will impose \"regulatory burdens that outweigh any likely benefits\". In a dubious bit of hyperbole, it claims legislation to stamp out price manipulation amounts to \"government price fixing\". Perhaps the last word should go to an anonymous respondent who wrote to the FTC under the name \"secret\" to warn: \"It is going to end up with killings at the gas stations because people cannot afford gas.\" Olympic spirit An email popped up in my inbox on Friday from a journalist friend in Toronto. \"Are you by any chance watching the Olympic thingy?\" he asked, referring to Beijing's lavish opening ceremony. \"It's all so beautifully understated ... you'd hardly know the Chinese had anything to do with it.\" Actually, I wasn't watching the ceremony - because Americans weren't allowed to watch it live, unlike Canadians, Britons or pretty much any other nationality on the planet. NBC, which has paid more than $600m for exclusive US broadcasting rights to the Olympics, decided that the opening ceremony was at an inconvenient time because it happened during the morning on America's east coast. So it taped the event and showed it \"as live\" at peak evening viewing time 12 hours later. While millions around the world were treated to elaborately choreographed drummers, the lighting of the flame and flag-carrying teams of athletes, Americans were subjected to a media black-out. NBC adopted a stazi-like approach to any websites which tried to break its monopoly. In a bizarre charade, anchormen from NBC's business offshoot, CNBC, presented part of their morning news show from a camera position outside the Beijing's \"bird's nest\" stadium but they had to pretend there was nothing going on inside. Even when a massive fireworks display turned the sky red directly behind them, they kept a straight face and completely ignored the bangs as this marvellous screenshot demonstrates. It all seems a bit of a shame. Some American viewers were driven to watching Spanish-language coverage of the opening ceremony on obscure cable television channels. NBC might be maximising their advertising revenue but they're not really capturing the Olympic spirit, are they? Hot and bothered A blast of good sense from New York's city council which looks set to fine shops which \"cool the sidewalk\" by leaving their doors wide open and their air conditioning on. It's quite common to see stores wasting energy in this way at the height of the Big Apple's scorching summer. If the bill goes through, first-time offenders will get a warning. Second time, it's a $200 fine and the third time, the cost goes up to $400. Bang to rights."

    "title": "Liquid bomb plot: three guilty of murder conspiracy",
    "content": "Three men were yesterday convicted of conspiring to commit mass murder through suicide bomb explosions, but a jury failed to reach a verdict on the allegation they were part of the biggest terrorist plot since the September 11 attacks. The Crown had alleged that eight Britons planned to blow up at least seven airliners heading to North America with 1,500 people aboard, in attacks that would have had a global impact. But yesterday a jury at Woolwich crown court failed to convict any of the defendants of conspiring to murder people by blowing up aircraft. After 56 hours of deliberations the jurors were hung on the central charge. By majority verdicts, the jury convicted the three men of conspiracy to commit murder. They were the cell's ringleader, Abdulla Ahmed Ali, the bombmaker Assad Sarwar, and Tanvir Hussain. They had pleaded guilty to conspiracy to cause explosions. One defendant, Mohammed Gulzar, whom the Crown alleged flew into Britain from Pakistan to oversee the plot, was acquitted of all charges. The jury failed to reach verdicts on four other defendants, who had earlier admitted conspiracy to cause a public nuisance by making al-Qaida style suicide videos. The alleged airline plot was disrupted in August 2006 when the men were arrested. The discovery of the cell and what counter-terrorism officials say was an al-Qaida inspired suicide mission led to weeks of chaos at airports in Britain and the US. The restrictions on liquids travellers can take in their hand luggage as a result of the allegations remain in force today. The additional security measures brought in since the arrests continue to cause disruption and delays at the UK's busiest airports. Last night the government was under pressure from the airlines and Britain's largest airport owner to review its airport security regime in the light of the verdicts. British Airways and Virgin Atlantic and BAA said the government should consider lifting the ban on carrying large amounts of liquids in hand luggage. Ali, Sarwar and Hussain will be sentenced on October 3, and the Crown Prosecution Service has until late this month to decide what it will do over the charges on which the jury failed to reach a verdicts. The eight men - seven from London and one from High Wycombe in Buckinghamshire - had denied the charges. The Crown said the men planned to smuggle the parts of a liquid bomb on to passenger planes. These liquid components would be disguised in soft drinks bottles to bypass airport security. Once on board, the devices would be assembled. Tests by government scientists, played to the jury, produced videos of the devices producing an explosion powerful enough to punch a hole in an aircraft fuselage. The Crown believed it had overwhelming evidence. Six of the men recorded suicide videos making threats against the west, which the prosecution said would have been released after the planes were blown up in mid-air. The security service MI5 had captured incriminating statements with covert listening and video devices planted in the east London flat which the cell used as a bomb factory. US and UK intelligence believe the cell was directed by al-Qaida leaders in Pakistan. Liquid explosives were to have been hidden in Lucozade and other soft drinks bottles. Disposable cameras would have been used to help set off the devices which would also contain regular batteries, hollowed out to contain chemicals. In their defence, Ali and Sarwar said they planned to record a documentary highlighting injustices against Muslims in Iraq, Afghanistan and Lebanon. Ali said he considered exploding a small device at the Houses of Parliament or Heathrow's terminal three as a publicity stunt to draw attention to the programme. He claimed martyrdom videos recorded by six of the defendants were a hoax to be used as part of the internet documentary to make it more shocking. In April while opening its case, the Crown played videos of Ali found after his arrest. In it he warned of \"body parts ... decorating the streets\" if Muslims were not left alone, and said he had yearned to take part in violent jihad since he was a teenager. In the martyrdom video he is seen speaking against the backdrop of a black flag with Arabic writing on it. Last night the CPS said: \"The prosecution is considering the request for a retrial in respect of the plot to blow up airliners against all seven men upon which the jury could not agree.\" The home secretary, Jacqui Smith, said: \"I am indebted to the police and security services who, by successfully disrupting this group, have saved countless lives. I would also thank the Crown Prosecution Service, which has worked tirelessly to ensure that these individuals have been brought to justice. I am sure they will now consider what to do where no verdict was reached.\" The trial judge, David Calvert-Smith, excused the jurors from any further service for the rest of their lives and offered his appreciation. \"Depart this court with the full-hearted thanks of the community for your service to it, which is far beyond the duty for most jurors, and my personal thanks,\" he told them."

Charlie Brooker gleefully and confidently assaults 9/11 \"troofers\" in his record-breaking Cif thread, but the core arguments against conspiracies in most high-profile cases – 9/11, JFK, Oklahoma City - work against a lone nut theory in the Jill Dando killing, and always did. The police are playing their usual game right now – hinting they're not considering any other suspects, revealing convictions and suspicions that were not put in front of the jury – suggesting with nods and winks that, regardless of the verdict, they know who did the deed. Their misplaced confidence was absurd from day one. There is not one chance in a billion that Barry George killed Jill Dando, and the Met must always have known this. I'll focus on just one aspect of the crime, but it's enough to prove the fragility of the overall police case. From the moment a brass cartridge case that once held the bullet that killed Dando was found, it was certain that whoever killed her was either a gunsmith himself, or had access to specialist weapons-making facilities – and it was a strong possibility that the killer hailed from Eastern Europe. The cartridge, a Remmington .380 casing, had been opened, and propellant removed to reduce the crack of a gunshot – then crimped back onto the slug, a 9mm round, creating a custom-built, low-powered, composite round. An old NKVD trick apparently, dating from Stalin's days. This simple fact instantly ruled out someone like George acting alone. He could not have prepared the ammunition himself, at no stage were the police able to link him to any facilities where he may have been able to do it, they were never able to connect him to a illegal firearms trader and were unable to turn up the weapon – or even suggest what kind of weapon it was, with any plausibility. Based purely on the ammunition, and the fact that the bullet bore no rifling marks, the police announced that a modified automatic, or reactivated inert automatic, drilled through, must have fired the round. Yet the case carried no extractor marks – the indentations, fairly distinctive for each type of gun, left on the case by the ejector mechanism of an automatic pistol or rifle. That means that it hadn't been ejected, which means it was not fired from an automatic pistol, which means the weapon used cannot have been of the type claimed by police. Rather, this was a custom device, possibly handmade. And this weapon, the police theory had it, would have been built by a man with no access to the necessary machinery, no history of engineering at all, who couldn't even drive and apparently has trouble doing up his buttons. There are two kinds of weapon that could have fired the shot that killed Jill Dando – both specialist devices, neither of them ever mentioned by the police. The first, a zip gun, is the most basic firearm in current use. A street gang or prison weapon, it's essentially two tubes sliding over each other, with a nail or steel rod welded to the base of one, to strike a cartridge held in place at the bottom of the other. Sometimes spring-loaded and sometimes purely manual, it's a clumsy and awkward weapon, and most street-built examples can only be operated with two hands. Witnesses described a tall man dressed in dark clothing, perhaps a black suit, carrying a large mobile phone. He, or someone very like him, was placed outside Dando's home, in her street, walking away from her garden immediately after the shooting, along with several other men and the famous blue Range Rover that was once a key target for the police investigation, and was then rapidly forgotten when it didn't fit their theory. He was carrying a large mobile phone. A gun, the police said – the witnesses must have been mistaken. But what if the witnesses weren't half-blind simpletons the police suggest? What if they saw exactly what they said they saw? What if they saw a man holding this? Covert handguns disguised as mobile phones, generally firing a .22 or 9mm round, have been found all over Europe – but they all appear to be manufactured in the same place, the former Yugoslavia. You can tell where I'm going with this can't you? The police theory – the \"rational\" theory – suggests a man with an IQ of 75 carried out such a killing, alone, and perfectly. It simply isn't credible, and it never was. The only credible theory is a that of a professional assassination, carried out on behalf of either a criminal organisation, angered by Dando's work on Crimewatch, or perhaps on behalf of someone else. This is the conspiracy theory – and yet it is the simplest option. The only question is who ordered the hit? People point to Crimewatch, but like the rest of the British media, they don't really \"do\" organised crime. Did Crimewach ever take down a gangland boss? And is it credible to suggest some poor bugger swindling widows out of their savings took revenge from his prison cell? I don't think so. So we turn to the other option. Chances are every state has people to deal with individuals they want removed. We don't know if our own country does, but with some nations, we know they have assassinated people in the recent past. Countries like, well, Serbia for instance. Add the fact that callers to the BBC after the killing claimed it on behalf of Serbia, that presenters such as John Humphrys were also threatened because of their perceived support for the Kosovan cause, and the Serbian connection must look credible. So why did the police focus on Barry George? Who knows. But I can guess. The Serbian theory posits revenge as the motive. Revenge for Clinton and Blair's illegal Kosovo war, but specifically for the war crime perpetrated by British and US forces in the early hours of April 23 1999, when Nato missiles smashed into the headquarters of Radio and Television Serbia killing 16 broadcasting staff. We bombed their state broadcaster – claiming it was a legitimate target as it propagandised for their side – and they struck back, so the theory goes. The BBC had presented hours of footage backing wholeheartedly the Nato line that Milosevic was a new Hitler, that \"humanitarian intervention\" was essential. Dando, no doubt in good faith, broadcast an appeal on behalf of the Kosovan refugees. That's more than enough motive. More of a motive than police ever suggested for Barry George. But not really a motive anyone in the UK establishment would want to talk up. Perhaps I'm being cynical – maybe the original police investigation really did think that the Serb theory, even though it fitted the facts, was not credible. But why might that be? Because it was a conspiracy theory? When even positing a conspiracy is enough to bring ridicule, might they actually have jettisoned the idea because of embarrassment? While it makes sense, as Charlie Brooker suggests, to try to remain close to planet Earth at all times, and not to drift too wildly on the seas of invention, it also makes sense to evaluate fairly all possibilities, especially those that fit the known facts, regardless of how fantastic those possibilities then become. As the greatest detective of them all once said: When you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains – however improbable – must be the truth. Barry George was finally found not guilty of the murder of Jill Dando last week, but the police should have known, nine years ago, that the idea that this man could commit such a breathtaking crime was simply that: impossible."

    "title": "No conspiracy here",
    "content": "The lead story in last week's Jewish Chronicle revealed the apprehension felt by some leading Jewish communal figures at the prominent involvement of two Jewish people, David Abrahams and Jon Mendelsohn, in the current Labour party funding controversy. The majority of people involved in the scandal are not Jewish, but coming soon after Lord Levy's involvement in the \"cash for honours\" inquiry, the involvement of more Jews in public scandals provokes understandable concern in the Jewish community. Given the long history of conspiracy theories featuring Jewish cabals and conspiracies, given the stereotypes of money-grubbing Jewish businessmen, Jews are acutely sensitive to anything that would confirm peoples' worst impressions of the Jewish community. Indeed, an earlier Jewish-linked scandal - the conviction of the \"Guinness Four\" in 1990 - sparked snide media references to the \"kosher nostra\". Even if Abrahams and Mendelsohn are only two players in a wider scandal, their Jewishness stands out. While it would be absurd and hateful to see the events of the last couple of weeks as evidence of a sinister Jewish conspiracy, it would also be wrong to claim that the Jewishness of the protagonists in this and the previous funding controversy was entirely incidental to it. On the contrary, to understand the controversy, you need to understand the Jewish contexts in which Michael Levy, David Abrahams and Jon Mendelsohn operate. The UK Jewish community of less than 300,000 people boasts an astonishingly varied and complex array of welfare, educational, cultural and other organisations, to say nothing of its several hundred synagogues. While not as wealthy as some imagine, British Jews are largely middle class and sophisticated networks of philanthropy ensure that Anglo-Jewish institutions are well provided for. Michael Levy came to prominence outside the business world as a fundraiser and philanthropist for Jewish causes, most notably Jewish Care, the communal welfare organisation. Similarly, David Abrahams has given generously to a range of Anglo-Jewish charities. While Jews have always been involved in the Labour party in significant numbers (and since the 1980s in the Conservative party too), the importance of Jewish donors to New Labour dates to the mid-1990s. The New Labour project stood or fell on its ability to build a donor base that would allow the Blair-Brown axis to avoid dependence on the unions. It is easy to see the attraction that Michael Levy held for Tony Blair when they met in 1994. Here was a man who was not just rich and generous in his own right, but who had ready access to a network of other potential donors. Levy was an integral part of \"the project\" not because of some sinister Zionist-inspired quest for influence, but because he offered skills honed and contacts made during his Jewish funding-raising. New Labour elevated a pre-existing Jewish network to national importance - and therein lies the problem. The Jewish community has long preferred to attempt to influence the political process through discreet advocacy and relationship building rather than through public demonstrations and campaigning. This discretion is rooted in long-standing concerns to be seen as good British citizens, to not show ingratitude to the \"hospitality\" of this country. British politics since the 1990s has witnessed a paradoxical process in which lobbying has become ever more important to government, yet ever more the object of public suspicion. Regardless of the truth or falsehood of the allegations against Abrahams and Mendelsohn, they have fallen victim to the distrust that has surrounded lobbying and private political donations since the early 90s. It is intriguing to note that both the British Jewish communal organisations and British political parties are increasingly reliant on a small number of \"high value\" donors. This is only a problem if those donations buy disproportionate influence. In the Jewish community the influence of a small number of very wealthy philanthropists is considerable and the same faces appear repeatedly on the boards of major Jewish charities. At the same time, the influence of communal grandees is counter-balanced by the community's vibrant grassroots volunteer culture, in which large numbers of British Jews ensure that the community's institutions can function. In contrast, the Labour party has seen its volunteer corps decimated in recent years in part as a direct result of the leadership's desire to curb the influence of the grassroots. There is little effective counterweight to the influence of major donors. Moreover, whereas bought influence in the Jewish community brings immaterial benefits such as kudos and self-esteem, bought influence in political parties can - potentially at least - bring very real material benefits. Philanthropy can be driven by the very worst and the very best motivations. We do not yet know and we may never know into what category David Abrahams political philanthropy falls. It is possible though that the structures of the British Jewish community may bring out the best in David Abraham and in other Jewish philanthropists, whereas the structures of the Labour party may well have brought out the worst. Jews do not corrupt politics - if anything, politics corrupts Jews."

    "title": "Sunny Hundal: Bring on the conspiracy",
    "content": "Over the past 60 years, the British left has won most of the arguments on social issues. From establishing a welfare system and healthcare to independent media, the pursuit of equality on gender, race and sexual orientation, and the environment, the consensus has tended to favour liberal-left movements. And yet there is an unshakeable feeling that, despite 10 years of Labour, the liberal-left movement is lost, divided and abandoned. The early momentum of Gordon Brown's ascension has waned. Progressives struggled to find the new ideas and transformative vision that they hoped for in Tuesday's Queen's speech. Does New Labour remain the vehicle for that vision? The party seems to have abandoned grassroots support as its backbone, instead choosing to position and market itself as the least worst option. David Cameron is doing much the same with the Tories. But while there is an unmistakeable stench around party politics, a revolution is brewing on the web. The internet is ushering in a new era of politics. Widespread discussion and campaigning on civil liberties, the environment, feminism and even foreign affairs is increasingly migrating online, where blogs and social networks such as YouTube, MySpace and Facebook create communities of shared interests and ideas. During the recent demonstrations in Burma, more than 450,000 people joined a Facebook group that organised protests worldwide, and the British campaigning group Avaaz raised more than $300,000 in online donations. The internet should favour politics on the left: it offers innovative means to organise people and allows independent media outlets to flourish with little cost. The US has shown the way. Progressive blogging networks there have helped activists to share information, do original reporting, raise campaign funds and broaden debate, helping shape the Democratic party's agenda and giving liberals a way to get involved. Yet in Britain the right has stolen a march. ConservativeHome, sounding board and news website for Tory activists and supporters, independently financed by YouGov's Stephan Shakespeare, is perhaps the best example of how party sympathisers can be engaged while bypassing the national media. Other supporters have launched Platform 10, to make the case for \"a modern, liberal Conservative agenda\". There are new projects in the pipeline from the Tory party itself. CampaignTogether, billed as the Conservative volunteer task force, is being used to galvanise activists online during elections; Stand Up Speak Up seeks to encourage voters to feed into the party manifesto. All this may so far have had little impact on the wider electorate, but it illustrates that the right is miles ahead in experimenting with the web to engage. And it is more than experimentation: the right is also marching together to shift the political agenda. Conservative bloggers constantly link to each other and promote editorials in publications such as the Spectator and the Telegraph. They are amplified by an online TV station - 18 Doughty Street - and fellow rightwing hacks; they disseminate online ads, videos and Tory views relentlessly. It is a formidable echo machine. And all this despite the enduring paranoia that the right is drowned out by a vast leftwing conspiracy on everything from abortion and climate change to immigration. But this is about more than party politics. The liberal-left, broadly, risks making little headway on core issues because of a painful lack of coalition building. It is characterised by single-issue groups working in isolation, denouncing each other over spurious issues and with little cross-campaigning and exchange of ideas. They've become fixated with demanding more legislation rather than shifting minds and conversations. There are simple questions to be asked. What is the liberal-left agenda for tomorrow? How can we then push that forward and make politicians listen? We have an opportunity to use the internet to involve a new generation of Britons to collaborate on campaigns as never before. That is the only way to stem the rising tide of political apathy and disillusionment, re-energise our base and seize the political initiative. The liberal-left has to think past single-issue campaigns and work together to push a progressive agenda for Britain. We need to do this, rather than simply hoping Brown will herald a new progressive age where Blair did not. We have to rebuild the grassroots and translate that into political action by using the web. If there wasn't one before, its time we got the vast liberal conspiracy off the ground. · Sunny Hundal is the editor of Liberal Conspiracy.org, launched this week, a website for progressive academics, thinktanks, pressure groups and bloggers www.liberalconspiracy.org"

    "content": "Five men have been arrested in connection with allegations of corruption in football, City of London police said today. Officers said the men were being held on suspicion of conspiracy to defraud and false accounting. The suspects - aged 69, 60, 55, 48 and 30 - were taken into custody as more than 60 police officers raided eight addresses. A spokeswoman for the force said three searches were continuing while five others had been completed. The raids were part of its economic crime unit's investigation which was launched more than a year ago to look into alleged bungs in the game. A spokeswoman said, however, they formed \"part of an ongoing investigation into football corruption\". Two people had been arrested previously: Tottenham's French defender Pascal Chimbonda and a 61-year-old man who was held on suspicion of money laundering. Both men are on police bail pending further inquiries. Last year, the Football Association brought in the former Metropolitan police commissioner Lord Stevens to carry out a separate inquiry into several hundred player transfers. His findings, which looked at 362 transfers between January 1 2004 and January 31 2006, cast doubt on 17 deals involving five clubs. The City of London police spokeswoman said she could not give any more details about the arrested men or the locations of the searches."

    "content": "And so it came to pass that Ingerland fans were dependant on the sons of Israel in order to reach the Promised Land, which is a bit of a stretch in many ways, not least because, if Austria-Switzerland is as good as travel gets, then there is a strong case for staying at home. This was an arguably demeaning predicament, but at least it was a novel one. And it allowed The Sun to put some new life into old jokes. Not least on its front page: 'Yeltsin, Gagarin, Lenin, Polonium, Ivan The Terrible, Tolstoy, Gorbachev, Ra-ra-Rasputin, Sharapova, Tchaikovsky, Abramovich. Israel will give your boys a hell of a beating.' The inclusion of a chemical element associated with the murder of Alexander Litvinenko between a couple of old politicos was a stroke of near genius. The jokes continued in a leader headlined 'Come on Israel' in which the paper exhorted everyone to cheer on 'the Middle East minnows'. And in the centre pages they kindly inserted a cut-out-and-keep Star of David flag 'to wave in front of the telly'. All fun and games, but the television wing of the operation were more concerned with darker arts. 'Should we believe in conspiracy theories?' asked Richard Keys with a gravitas more becoming the definitive programme on the Kennedy assassination than a Euro qualifier. Such talk flew over the heads of Glenn Hoddle and Trevor Francis, neither of whom would convince as colleagues of George Smiley. They just wanted to establish their Zionist credentials. 'I say \"we\" because we're supporting Israel, of course,' said Trevor Francis. 'Good man,' said Glenn Hoddle before going on to talk about 'we' 'having a problem away from home'. But weren't Israel at home? How many first-person plurals can one have in one lifetime? Over in the stadium, Rob Hawthorne was worried that there were 'plenty of empty seats. And most of those that are occupied appear to be occupied by Russian supporters.' He was obviously, and perhaps blissfully, unaware that millions of supporters of 'the Middle East minnows' were in Britain and waving Star of David flags in front of the telly. Hawthorne, meanwhile, was seated next to a less starry David. 'I think he should have pulled the trigger there,' said Platt after Elyaniv Barda had fannied about around the grassy penalty spot. A minute later it was irrelevant as Israel scored. 'The dream start. It's Barda,' said Hawthorne. 'What a start for England,' said Platt. That's the trouble with conspiracy theories in today's 24/7 globalised culture: they have a very short shelf life. And if it were to be a conspiracy, it was going to have to be an extraordinarily subtle and sinuous one. Platt, however, remained suspicious, criticising Ben Sahar for 'electing to pull the trigger too early'. You can see why Sky paid good money to fly Platt from Vienna to Tel Aviv. When the theme of your night is conspiracy a pundit whose catchphrase is 'pulling the trigger' is an obvious choice. Russia, meanwhile, were looking limpid. Could the conspiracy theorists have been looking in the wrong direction? What if JT, Lamps and the Coley had put some heat on The Roman? What if Abramovich had responded to that deep heat? What if he had put club before country? A lot of 'what ifs', admittedly, but Glenn and Trevor declined the bait. And then Russia equalised and there was talk of 'the increasing Russian threat' and what destructive weapons they might launch in the next 30, not even 45, minutes. The threat proved illusory. Although it was close. 'He's hit the post, the post saves England,' said Hawthorne. Before exulting 'Golan it is, who has hit the heights'. And ending by stating 'all those conspiracy theorists are blown out of the water.' History will show that it was The Sun, with its cut-out-and-keep Star of David flags, that won it."

I took the view, along with other Lib Dem and Labour MPs, that the commissioner must bear responsibility for the serious failings that led to an innocent man being killed. The man responsible for the Met's national counterterrorism capability must be able to command public confidence. Writing in the Guardian, Ken Livingstone fumed that I was \"desperate to get him\" for altogether ulterior motives, because \"Sir Ian is one of the most successful Metropolitan police commissioners in years at reducing crime\" (A blemished Tory record, November 14). Mr Livingstone stated: \"The explanation of this paradox is that Blair's success shows up the failure of the policies previously supported by Davis, the shadow home secretary - which led to a reduction of police numbers in London and a consequent explosion in crime.\" This conspiracy theory is utter nonsense. First, crime in London was decreasing under the last Conservative government. While there have been some improvements under this government, violent crime has risen dramatically since 1998 - in London and nationwide. Robberies have almost doubled in the capital, and over the last year we have witnessed a horrific surge in gun-related violence. No one believes this government or the mayor when they claim the opposite. Second, while police numbers are up, a rising tide of paperwork has buried officers under their desks, when we need them on the streets. Third, whatever Sir Ian's record on local policing in London, some of which I have praised, it has little to do with his separate responsibility for leading the Met's national counterterrorism command. It was independently demonstrated - during the criminal trial and by the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) - that serial failures under Sir Ian's leadership resulted in the fatal shooting of De Menezes at Stockwell station, and put the public at serious risk. Mr Livingstone himself said publicly that \"the system did fail\". As head of the Met, Sir Ian is directly responsible. The IPCC also censured Sir Ian for trying to block its investigation, despite his legal duty to cooperate fully. If Sir Ian had succeeded we would never have been able to learn the lessons provided by the IPCC report. The commissioner, the nation's most senior law enforcement officer, cannot operate above the law. Mr Livingstone has also claimed that the Conservatives are politicising the issue. Yet calls for Sir Ian to step down have come from all parties. The London Assembly passed a vote of no confidence. Kate Hoey - the Labour MP for the Stockwell area - called for Sir Ian's resignation because \"the confidence in my community has been affected\". Does Mr Livingstone think she is politicising the issue too? · David Davis MP is the shadow home secretary davisd@parliament.uk"

    "title": "Stench of conspiracy at BAE Systems",
    "content": "The boardroom dynamics of BAE Systems are hard to read at the best of times, but the natural reading of chief executive Mike Turner's departure seems clear: he was pushed. The killer quote was provided by Turner in June, when he seemed to pitch publicly for an extension. \"I'm a fairly young guy,\" he said. \"I've been through some difficult times a few years ago, but the company is in great shape. Why would I want to stop now?\" Why indeed? He is 59, has worked at the company since his teenage years, and retirement age at BAE is 65. Turner himself says he will now look for a job elsewhere, albeit in a non-executive role. It's not as if shareholders were demanding change. The shares have performed wonderfully in recent years, a fact that usually baffles those who only associate BAE with allegations of bribery. On the business front, Turner did well. He weathered the rows with the Ministry of Defence over the costs of the Nimrod aircraft and Astute submarine programmes. His single-minded vision for expansion - more American assets - was controversial, but successful. Becoming the world's biggest builder of armoured vehicles, from an American base, has paid off handsomely thanks to conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq. So why's he going? It looks as if winds of change are blowing through BAE. Chris Geoghegan and Steve Mogford, co-chief operating officers, have already resigned this year, so Turner's exit next August means members of BAE's old guard are becoming harder to spot. New faces might be deemed desirable at this point: the US department of justice is still investigating allegations that BAE paid bribes to Saudi officials. BAE says its relationship with the US government is unaffected, but it's also its job to ensure that's always the case. Was chairman Dick Olver behind Turner's departure? Was it a boardroom coup? There is sometimes danger in smelling conspiracy at BAE. On this occasion, the stench is powerful. Mixed message Another day, another record oil price, and another chance for Opec to say it is not to blame for the rising cost of energy. The cartel thinks \"speculators\" are behind it. A similar line was heard when the price of a barrel of oil passed $60, $70 and $80. Now that $90 is in sight, Opec could at least be charitable and admit that the speculators were onto something. The truth is that oil is a large, widely-traded market. Speculative interest from hedge funds, investment banks and even pension funds has grown enormously but it is still hard for prices to be pushed around artificially. Rather, the pricing environment is extremely tight, as the analysts put it. This time last year Opec was actually cutting production and its concessions since have been modest. At the same time, non-Opec producers have struggled to meet their production targets, as BP's shareholders know well. On the demand side, the global economy continues to defy the gloomsters. Even the International Energy Agency admitted a few months ago that it under-estimated the growth of China and India, and upped its forecast of demand from 2% to 2.2%. The difference is fractional, but revealed where the medium-term pressure on prices lies. Throw a political worry into the mix - this time tensions between Turkey and Iraq - and a price spike can follow. It can't last forever, of course. Sooner or later, high prices affect demand and slow economic growth. It must happen, but it's anybody's guess where the critical point lies. Many pundits would have said $80 was a natural ceiling. As for Opec, it says it \"does not favour\" oil prices at the current level but nor does it have firm plans to increase supplies. That's a mixed message. Lop-sided Compare and contrast, as they say, the tales from these two companies. Burberry, the beige check people, say demand for their luxury handbags has never been stronger. The item of the season is apparently the Knight bag, retailing at a cool £1,595. It helped Burberry report a 25% rise in half-year sales. Over in the US, DR Horton, the country's biggest housebuilder, said it sold 39% fewer homes in the third quarter than a year ago, a period which itself saw a 25% plunge. The cancellation rate was 48%, an extraordinary statistic. So luxury handbags are in demand, and mid-market US houses are not. Never mind the unfairness, it's hard to know how such a lop-sided economy will behave. No wonder the stock market is veering between thoughts of catastrophe and confidence of salvation. nils.pratley@theguardian.com"

    "title": "Crying conspiracy is no reply",
    "content": "There's something slightly desperate about the tendency of neo-liberal apologists to cry \"conspiracy theory\" whenever anyone lifts the curtain on the political and corporate forces driving their devastating crusade to remake the world. It's long been a tendency of Anglo-Saxon culture to sign up to the \"cock-up\" rather than the \"conspiracy\" view of history, of course, but the refusal to accept that powerful interests and ideologies have shaped the post-1991 world - rather than simply random events - is just bizarre. It's certainly already been one persistent response to the Guardian's extracts from Naomi Klein's new book The Shock Doctrine - in John Lloyd's blog, on the threads and in some broadcast interviews. Lloyd calls Klein's account of Russia's path to catastroika and social meltdown under the tutelage of free-market fundamentalists and their western sponsors \"conspiratorial\" - and even grossly tries to link it with the Tsarist anti-semitic forgery Protocol of the Elders of Zion. If you're short on arguments, portraying your critics as paranoid unsophisticates and somehow akin to \"Elvis lives\" freaks may be the best you can do. But it's got nothing to do with Klein's chilling rehearsal of the deliberate destruction of Russia's economic and social infrastructure and its developing democratic culture under Gorbachev in the name of the free market. Russia's own Chicago boys were unashamed admirers of General Pinochet's Friedmanite immolation of Chilean society. And the parallels and connections Klein meticulously draws between Latin America's original 1970s economic shock treatment under rightwing dictatorships and the shock therapy imposed on Russia and eastern Europe in the 1990s lay the basis for an unanswerable thesis: namely, that radical neoliberal policies have thrived and depended on social crises and violence for their dramatic advance across the globe over the past generation. This is the \"disaster capitalism\" that Klein argues has reached its apogee in the war on terror and the corporate feeding frenzy it has involved both in Iraq and the US itself. Klein has been criticised in the past few days for trying articifially to force varied and complex experiences to fit her thesis - including that of monetarism and privatisation under Margaret Thatcher in the 1980s. But the wider picture she paints in fact illuminates familiar territory. Thatcher's free market transformation of the British economy followed the Chilean model pretty closely. But full-scale privatisation only took off on the back of the Falklands war and the huge turnaround in her political fortunes it brought about. The war unleashed a wave of jingoistic fervour, but it also delivered a jolting shock to the political culture of the time. Epitomised by the defence ministry spokesman Ian McDonald's almost nightly dead-pan statements to camera on the TV news, there was a powerful sense of the state reasserting itself after years of social disorder. That would then be followed through after the 1983 election with the state-driven assaults on the miners and other centres of labour movement resistance to the new order. Conor Foley is right that Klein's book is the most creative attempt yet to draw out the links between the global corporate takeover and the US-led imperial wars that have been the focus of international protest over the past decade. And it is precisely because she is so effective at both reporting and dramatising those links to a new generation of activists that she is attacked and patronised by those who would prefer they were never made.

    "content": "The knock-out stage of the World Cup officially starts next week - it already has for the Six Nations countries - and conspiracy theories are starting to abound. Why were the balls used by the outside-half Daniel Carter in kicking practice last week markedly different from the match ball against Scotland at Murrayfield - an afternoon when the world's most accurate kicker had a strike rate of less than 50 per cent - despite an official ruling that they would be one and the same? Why did a French newspaper last week publish a scurrilous story concerning the Ireland outside-half and key player Ronan O'Gara, days before France's group match against the men in green in Paris, a game Les Bleus had to win, or at least not lose, to avoid being dumped out of the tournament they were hosting? Why was the South Africa centre Francois Steyn cited for allegedly biting the Tonga wing Joseph Vaka's hand when there was no evidence that any such incident had occurred? Had Steyn, who has taken over from the injured Jean de Villiers, been banned, his absence would have left a hole in the Springboks' midfield as the tournament entered its crucial stage. New Zealand are the favourites to win the World Cup with South Africa behind them. Ireland were merely standing between France and the avoidance of the most ignominious of exits. Coincidence or conspiracy? You decide. France were bitterly aggrieved when they narrowly lost the 1995 World Cup semi-final to South Africa in damp Durban. The Springboks were awarded a try which a video official would rule out today, while France scored a genuine one which was disallowed. They returned home muttering about the game being fixed, with some defamatory allegations made. New Zealand, who lost in the final in Johannesburg, claimed their food was spiked two days before that game and that the night before it a symphony of car alarms sounded outside their hotel. A South African website today claimed that Steyn was \"stitched up\". It said that an unnamed member of the Springbok management team received a telephone call from a \"Tonga team official\" apologising for the citing of the centre. The official is reported to have said that Tonga had not wanted to cite Steyn and added that they were forced to, refusing to elaborate on who had put the squeeze on. The website smelled more than one rat, pointing out that the Tonga coach Quddus Fielea had said after the game they would not be asking the citing commissioner to look at any incidents and that he hoped \"my fellow South Africans agree with me\". It turned out the citing was initiated by the Tongan management. The website contrasted Steyn's citing with the lack of action taken against three Australian players and the Wales captain Gareth Thomas for acts of foul play at the Millennium Stadium on September 15, and a punch allegedly thrown by the New Zealand prop Carl Hayman which did not prompt an invitation to attend a disciplinary committee session. \"It was a load of rubbish,\" said Steyn after being cleared at his hearing yesterday. \"I am disappointed in the Tongan who made untrue allegations. He had a tiny mark on his hand which could have been caused by a boot. I am glad it's all over but I am not relieved because everyone will think that I am a dirty player.\" Conspiracy theories have become rife in the professional era. The former New Zealand captain Tana Umaga published his autobiography today and media attention has focused on the spear tackle he and the All Blacks hooker Keven Mealamu made on the Lions' captain Brian O'Driscoll in the first minute of the opening Test of the series two years ago. The pair were not cited for the challenge, which left O'Driscoll with a dislocated shoulder, despite compelling evidence. The Lions were unable to get an explanation from the citing officer and privately expressed the fear that he had been got at. Wales hosted the 1999 World Cup and were then coached by Graham Henry, now of New Zealand. They were knocked out in the quarter-finals by the eventual winners, Australia. Henry was convinced the Wallabies had cracked Wales's line-out calls and some of their moves. It was claimed some months later that an Australian who was working on the university site where Wales's notational analysis team was based left his job immediately after Wales had been knocked out. Presumably, he could take no more of the Welsh weather."

    "title": "Binoche falls for 9/11 conspiracy theories",
    "content": "br> Juliette thinks there's something Bush isn't telling us. Photograph: PA : Stefan Rousseau Whatever the sometimes varying quality of her films, I've always thought fondly of Juliette Binoche as an actor of talent, taste and intelligence. That, it seems, was a mistake. While she remains talented, and no doubt extremely tasteful, Binoche has plummeted in my estimation by publicly coming out as a September 11 conspiracy theorist. In a Radio 5 interview on Monday, Binoche told a clearly baffled Simon Mayo that her interest in the subject went well beyond the 9/11-themed film she was officially promoting, A Few Days in September. While she was coy on whether she merely believes the Bush administration knew about the plot and failed to act, or buys into the full nonsense of explosives-rigged towers and cruise missiles hitting the Pentagon, Binoche was adamant the official version of events was incorrect. \"It's obvious. Why don't people want to wake up and see?\" she said in the slightly smug, knowing tone of voice beloved of the 9/11 theorists. \"We know the connection of the Bush family with the Arabic families who own the gas and everything, so come on. So we can't just say we didn't know,\" she added. Much of her information, Binoche divulged, came from a \"secret agent\" who happens to be her neighbour (\"Not very secret for much longer,\" commented Mayo in a slightly acid tone). Binoche later repeated her conspiracy theories, and even the neighbour story, on our own Film Weekly podcast, which you can listen to here. The interviews, plus similar infuriatingly cryptic comments in a Daily Telegraph article earlier this month, have seen Binoche eagerly adopted by the self-styled 9/11 \"truth movement\". One site - the reassuringly-named Patriots Question 9/11 - now lists Binoche among a host of film world September 11 conspiracy theorists, the others either familiarly counter-cultural (Woody Harrelson) or else those not known for their intellectual capability (Charlie Sheen). To me, the 9/11 conspiracy theories are the height of intellectual flabbiness. Apart from the sheer absurdity of such a complex plan being carried out without a peep from any of the hundreds - even thousands - of people involved, they are both lazy and deeply dishonest, another attempt to make a sometimes arbitrary, frightening world more intelligible by blaming shocking events on some all-powerful cabal. And, as others have pointed out, focusing on such arrant nonsense obscures more important lessons to be learned from September 11 and its aftermath. But should it matter? I can safely enjoy - or not - films by John Travolta and Tom Cruise without caring they believe humanity is afflicted by the spirits of an alien race. Why do Binoche's opinions bother me so much?"

    "title": "Alexis Petridis: The tight jeans conspiracy",
    "content": "Not long ago, a singer-songwriter acquaintance bemoaned an unsuccessful shopping trip on his blog: \"I looked at clothes but, as I am not a gay teenager, couldn't find anything.\" Shortly after writing that, he co-wrote an album that went to number one in 16 countries, thus relieving himself of the need to look at anything in shops other than exquisite clothes with price tags matching the combined national debt of all those countries where his album had hit number one. Even so, any man who has stood in a clothes shop and felt the uncomfortable sensation of fashion passing him by can empathise with the remark. It's become particularly apt recently, too, thanks to the rise of tight jeans. After years of utilitarian trousers that anyone could wear - combats, cinchback jeans - fashion has opened up the generation gap again. They might have looked sexy and raffish on Dior Homme's models or the kids outside your local indie club, but as anyone who's huffed and puffed in Gap or Topman's changing room and emerged with their previously unnoticeable gut protruding over their waistband will tell you, if you're over 30, forget it. The appeal of tight jeans is obvious. They set you apart from Nuts readers and Wetherspoons patrons, clinging as doggedly to the perennially horrible distressed-bootcut-denim-and-hideous-loafers combination as they do to their bottles of WKD. They conjure images of ineffable cool: Bob Dylan circa 1965, the Clash in 1977. But they were barely 20 then. Better to conjure instead with a less exalted image from rock's past: the thirtysomething Rod Stewart cramming himself into very tight striped pants and looking, as Clive James put it, like a bifurcated marrow. Better to recognise that wearing tight jeans past 30 is the fashion equivalent of buying a red Maserati and boffing your secretary: a midlife crisis in miniature."

    "title": "Letters: Climate change is no conspiracy",
    "content": "Piers Corbyn (Letters, November 10) advocates inaction over greenhouse gases because he is apparently convinced that CO2 does not cause climate change. This is in contradiction to everything we expect from basic physics. No one disputes that other factors - such as volcanic eruptions, changes in solar activity and the pattern of Earth's orbit around the sun - also cause climate to vary. These factors are all taken into account in models, but the recent warming can only be explained if increased CO2 is included. Corbyn points out that CO2 increased over the past 8,000 years; however, Antarctic ice cores show that this increase was only around 7% until the early 19th century, and, as expected, played only a minor role in the climate of this period. The 36% increase that occurred since then has started to have a noticeable effect, which is certain to grow. CO2 has indeed increased in response to a temperature change in the past, as, for example, at the end of the last ice age. However, this is not reassuring, because the CO2 increase then acted to warm the Earth further, acting as an amplifier of otherwise small changes in other factors. The concentration is now 30% higher than at any time in the last 650,000 years, so we have no example from the past to test what will happen. Dr Eric Wolff British Antarctic Survey Piers Corbyn lacks a geological perspective. While the present roughly 100,000-year glacial and inter-glacial climate cycles are primarily driven by changes in the orbital eccentricities of the Earth around the sun they are strongly linked to atmospheric C02 levels. So in making the all-too-common error that the end of the last ice age was 10,000 years ago, which is only the case when measured in radiocarbon time, rather than around 11,600 years ago in real time, he fails to understand that such dates are corrected for the massive release of ancient C02 depleted in carbon 14 at around this time. This resulted in further warming which led to further releases of C02 until our present inter-glacial climate stabilised. Normally, CO2 levels in historic ice cores have ranged from 180 parts per million during ice ages to 280 ppm in the intervening warmer interglacial periods. Industrial revolution levels have already risen to 380 ppm. Also, far from being a steady rise, the directly measured increase in atmospheric CO2 levels since 1958 is accelerating and has nearly reached 2 ppm a year, which is a geologically unprecedented rate of change. David Nowell Fellow, Geological Society Piers Corbyn would greatly improve the integrity of his argument if he stuck to the science, instead of trotting out the tired and ridiculous idea that there is some kind of global scientific conspiracy to deliberately mislead the population about global warming in order that the so called \"climate crisis industry\" can \"make a lot of money\". Just how much money does he think the average climate scientist in academia is making from this dishonest scam? And this from a man who keeps his own possible contribution to the debate - his \"solar weather technique\" - a secret. Springing to mind is a phrase involving stones and glass houses (or, indeed, greenhouses). Richard Nunn Stirling I'm surprised that in all the recent excitement about global warming no one has mentioned the government's track record on environmental taxes. The landfill tax was introduced in 1996, the climate change levy in 2002 and the aggregates levy in 2002. The purpose of these taxes was to make companies pay for the environmental damage caused by their activities, but then the tax was to be returned to employers by reductions in national insurance contributions, totalling some 0.6%, making the taxes \"revenue neutral\". Except of course that the NI fund was now losing some £2bn per annum. It was anticipated that the fund would be compensated for this loss but instead the Treasury has pocketed the proceeds while the burden of these taxes has fallen on the NI fund. So the environmental taxes have, in fact, been paid for by pensioners. Hugh Emerson Crewe, Cheshire"

    "title": "Has the conspiracy theory come of age?",
    "content": "Has the conspiracy theory come of age? To judge by how the Litvinenko affair has spiralled like a runaway catherine wheel, throwing off cascades of suspects, locations, accusations, denials and scenarios - yes it has. It cannot just be the story, labyrinthine as it is. Somehow the world's onlookers doubt the existence of truth and the possibility of uncovering it. TV thrillers offer the forensic promise that a crime will always be solved, and a random-stop DNA swab can irrefutably convict an unsuspected murderer. Yet despite police and parliamentary inquiries, it remains a mystery who killed 300 people in bombings which sowed panic in Russia in 1999 and enabled then prime minister Vladimir Putin to justify a second war in Chechnya, and six months later swept him to the presidency. Alexander Litvinenko alleged it was the FSB who organised the bombings, a claim dismissed by Putin as \"delirious nonsense\". Also in reply, the FSB produced a photo of Litvinenko's bombings witness, Achimez Gochiayev, together with a Chechen leader, Movladi Baisarov - whose allegiances have strangely shifted in the murky conflict. Almost unnoticed, Baisarov was shot dead by police in Moscow at the same time Litvinenko was dying in a hospital bed. Over in the United States this year, the White House has been forced to produce a major inquiry specifically to refute the widespread claim that in 2001 it was the CIA or Mossad who blew up the World Trade Centre, in order for America to declare war on Islam. And is not the subsequent supposed power of al-Qaida's network, and the weirdly undead spectre of Osama bin Laden, the stuff of paranoid fantasy, of nightmares? Lebanon is on the brink of civil war over the attempt by the UN to get to the bottom of Syria's undoubted part in the blowing-up of Rafik Hariri - we know a security chief in Damascus \"committed suicide\" with three pistol shots after phoning Lebanese radio to confess he had a role. In Britain, millions of pounds have been spent to prove beyond doubt that the Princess of Wales was mistaken when she predicted that the heir to the throne would have her killed in a car crash - while readers of the Express are daily fed just such Diana conspiracy theories. The term entered the Oxford English Dictionary in 1997 as \"a belief that some covert but influential agency is responsible for an unexplained event\". The first British citation is Karl Popper's Open Society of 1952: \"I call it the 'conspiracy theory of society' - the view that an explanation of a social phenomenon consists in the discovery of the men or groups who are interested in the occurrence of this phenomenon.\" Thus politics in Russia, the one common denominator in the Litvinenko enigma, may have nothing to do with evolving democracy or our old friend market forces, but rather is a murderous clash of oligarchies over wealth, like Machiavelli's Borgias, or a Hollywood Godfather IV view of events. It is true that the classic question by conspiracy theorists - cui bono, who stands to gain? - provides only speculation; it suggests \"why\", but does not show \"how\". Nevertheless, if Popper aimed at ideology and the writing of history, the argument has widened to science itself, worshipped as the source of technology and even the prospect of immortality, and viewed as the objective rampart of the real against freewheeling thought. But philosophy is embroiled in the \"Science Wars\", where Popper's faith in progress by conjecture and refutation has been demonstrated by Thomas Kuhn to be naive in explaining why science undergoes revolutions - why theories persist when confronted by overwhelming contradictory evidence, and yet suddenly or prematurely collapse in the face of other, as yet untested, hypotheses. Darwin's evolution is under threat from \"intelligent design\" theory, which cannot be disproved by experiment or refuted by argument, but only attacked by asking creationists who they think this designer is. If conspiracy theorists are mad, one then has to ask why we wait with baited breath, as in an unfolding Greek tragedy, while the Metropolitan police investigate the possibility, hardening week by week, that unbelievably there was a criminal conspiracy hatched inside No 10. And there was the unwinding of the WMD affair, the supposedly real but entirely imaginary casus belli. Today there is an analogous casting-around for a rationale for Britain to contemplate its own nuclear holocaust. In both the \"cash for honours\" and the Litvinenko cases, John Reid, the home secretary, used almost precisely the same words to assure MPs that Scotland Yard would remorselessly follow any lead wherever it might take them. In an intriguing way, he expressed faith in that hero of our times, the detective or investigator, the epitome of empiricism's take on the truth - even as bewildered Litvinenko commentators voiced profound doubt we would ever know who had the former FSB lieutenant colonel assassinated. In a Chechen press message from London to embattled pro-west Ukrainians in 2004 (you will recall that was when their leader, Victor Yushchenko, was poisoned with dioxin), Alexander Litvinenko warned his former colleagues (of course he included Vladimir Putin) or Chekists, as the heirs to Lenin and Trotsky's secret police proudly call themselves: \"I declare that our common enemy is the Cheka - ie, those who in the offices of the so-called body of state security are spinning their bloody web of plots and intrigues setting on the civil population to fight. \"... Comrade Chekists, the moment of truth will come to you, and you will not be able to escape from the people's anger, as it happened in 1991, when you managed 'to write off' your sins attributing them to the marasmic [decaying] Central Committee of the KPSU. \"Only Chechens, Georgians and Ukrainians have stood up against you so far; the Byelorussians, Ingush, Balkarians, Russian and thousand representatives of the enslaved and humiliated peoples are waiting for their turn. \"Then, you will have to fight with them personally, as no criminals will help you. \"Indeed, one cannot say you are in luck's way, comrade Chekists! Today the Ukrainians are defending not only their freedom, but also that of all freedom-loving peoples, because we have one common enemy - the Cheka!\" Litvinkenko somehow managed to flee to London in 2002 after being held for months in former NKVD prisons over a flurry of criminal cases which he demonstrated in court to be crude attempts to frame him. Gazeta Russia noted at the time that the rush was due to an incoming law preventing trials in absentia, and said: \"For the FSB it is now a matter of honour to have Litvinenko convicted, no matter what.\" Subsequently the Russian state has re-authorised the practice of killing opponents abroad. A year ago, in an article in the Times about the former spy living in London, it was casually if presciently noted that \"perhaps partly because the FSB has omitted to take a poisoned umbrella to Mr Litvinenko, his revelations have turned out to be a bit of a damp squib\". Curiously, at the moment he was taken ill, the man in charge of the Bulgarian security archives (repository of secrets about who ordered Pope John-Paul assassinated and the Markov poisoning in London, and about to be opened for the first time), died in unexplained circumstances, thought to have \"committed suicide\". However, if one persists in claiming that postmodernism's scepticism has won the day, surely the WMD case proves precisely that this is not so, that truth will out? Hardly. All it did was demonstrate that you cannot trust what you are told by those in power. Is Fidel Castro, the target of 101 CIA covert assassinations, still alive in hospital, or was it his ghost lingering on in the squares of Havana while Cuba celebrated his 80th birthday on December 2? Are 60.5 million copies of The Da Vinci Code merely a testament to airport reading? And if we know the Warren report was botched, who did kill JFK?"

    "title": "What Jewish conspiracy?",
    "content": "Jonathan Freedland posted a piece on the arrest of Lord Levy yesterday on Comment is Free and then a slightly tidied up version appeared in the Guardian this morning. There are, therefore, two separate comment threads relating to this piece. Freedland argued that the scandal of loans-for-peerages goes to the heart of New Labour's relationships with corporate power and that Levy will not be (and should not be) the fall-guy or the scapegoat for this political problem problem. Freedland is right to flag up the danger of an anti-semitic undercurrent lurking around this story. \"In the routine descriptions of him as a 'flamboyant north London businessman' many in Britain's Jewish community have long detected old-fashioned prejudice.\" Traditional English anti-semitism has a habit of lurking gently under the surface. It is gentle and unspoken. It operates through a nudge here and a wink there. So Freedland mentions it - but it is not the point of the story and should not become the point of the story. Then up pops commenter \"Rodi\", at 0323 UK time with a Jewish conspiracy story. He links the Jew Freedland with the Jew Levy by means of the \"Israel Lobby\". \"Is it really a \"lazy scapegoating\"? I do not think so. Let us not forget that Jonathan Freedland was a strong supporter of the war (and of Bus& Blair narratives for its justification) on Iraq until it began to go even worse. He has then tried to distance himself. So I myself will be a little suspicious of what he writes on a subject as this, Lord Levy's dealings with Blair and the British government at such a critical time. I sense that there is another side of the story, which will hopefully emerge, even partially. All the records of Lord Levy need a very careful study. The question: is there a strong 'Israel lobby' in Britain as well and Lord Levy, a prominent agent of it? The recently published excellent paper on the US Israel lobby by two American professors may provide an example: http://www.lrb.co.uk/v28/n06/mear01_.html \"Rodi\" is wrong about Freedland being a supporter of the war and a supporter of Bush and Blair's arguments for war. Freedland has of course, from the beginning, been an outspoken opponent of the war. Perhaps Rodi has confused the Jew Freedland with the Jew Aaronovitch or the Jew Geras? Wisely Rodi uses the \"respectable\" language of the \"Israel lobby\" rather than the discredited language of Jewish conspiracy. He relies on Mearsheimer and Walt, the two neo-realist international relations professors who argued that the \"Lobby\" had forced or tricked the USA into acting against its own interests and in the interests of Israel by removing the Saddam regime from power. \"Rodi\" impatiently awaits the emergence of the evidence that will link Lord Levy and his dodgy financial dealings to Freedland, the ideological scribbler for the \"Lobby\" and to Ariel Sharon (via the Zionist dupes Blair and Bush). It was predictable back in March that even after the Mearsheimer and Walt paper had been entirely discredited by scholarly critique, that it would still function as an \"authority\" for people who were looking for a respectable way to believe in Jewish conspiracy. \"Ancientpistol\" pops up at 0435: \"I'm with Rodi on this\". Meanwhile, on the other thread, \"ForeverPalestine\" adds his analysis: \"Britains Jewish community, when they arent peddling open prejudice against Muslims or supporting zionist facism, are apt to see \"long detected old-fashioned prejudice\" in any comment about someone who happens to be jewish which isnt ars* kissing of the highest order.\" \"MayorWatch\" then weighs in with a misreading of Freedland, saying \"Sorry Jonathan but it's all a bit too easy to hurl claims of \"old-fashioned prejudice\" just because a Nu Labour acolyte is in a spot of bother.\" But Freedland isn't trying to \"use\" a charge of anti-semitism to protect Blair, he is trying to prevent a cloud of anti-Semitism from helping to rescue Blair. Then more wisdom from \"ForeverPalestine\": \"...find an extreme anti-Muslim writer/commentator and they will invariably be either jewish or a strong supporter of Israel.\" OK. Enough said about \"ForeverPalestine\" - except, what an embarrassment to genuine supporters of a free and democratic Palestine. And up pops a new character by the name of \"Enlight\", recommending that we read more about \"Lord Schmooze\". Enlight has spotted another tentacle underpinning the British war effort: \"I would also like to see an investigation into the activities of another Jew, Lord Goldsmith and how he legalised the war on iraq thereby allowing our troops to die for Israel.\" \"Ruthe\" also likes conspiracy theory, but a version not linked to Jews (yet). Ruthe believes that the separation of powers between the Met and the government is nothing other than a charade: \"I think the dramatic arrest of Lord Levy was the ultimate manipulation to stop the Select Committee starting their investigation again.\" But no, conspiracy theory always seems to link to the Jews eventually. It only takes 'Ruthe' another 12 minutes to come up with this: \"I can't really understand how somebody who is Jewish could be a special envoy for the Middle East. How could he show partiality?\" Freudian slip or just evidence of illiteracy? \"Tox06\" represents another classic element of antisemitism. Those Jews are so touchy, aren't they? \"I really dislike the knee-jerk suggestion that all this is motivated by mere anti-Semitism.\" Nobody suggested that \"all this\" is motivated by antisemitism - certainly not Freedland. \"Beslam\" then decides that it is important that we know what Levy's middle name is: \"Michael Abraham Levy\", not Lord Levy. \"Precon\" wants to make something else clear, that those at the heart of the Guiness insider dealing scandal in the 80s \"weren't the scapegoats but the leading lights quirky.... Most but not all were Jewish but if you look at Federal Court records for the 1980's the majority of people caught & prosecuted for this type of Financial crime were Jewish.\" 13 minutes later 'Precon' comes back with a quote from Tam Dalyell, a believer in the dangerous effects of Jewish advisors around Tony Blair. \"Downsman\" introduces another \"corrupt\" rich New Labour Jewish \"Lord\" into the discussion: \"There is a separate conflict issue about his business affairs and his science portfolio, but this has nothing to do with his ethnicity. We need some clear thinking here otherwise the anti-semitism label gets easily slapped over all discussions of any prominent person who happens to be jewish.\" The delightful \"Enlight\" then brings to our attention two more murderers, in case we had forgotten: \"What about the Jewish Albright when she said that the death of half a million Iraqi children was a price worth paying (sanctions on Iraq). As for the mass murderer Kissinger..\" \"Antiscensorship\" is on to something clever though: \"I suppose Jonathan Freedland is also Jewish.\" You think? Well well well, the plot thickens, huh? Anticensorship knows what he's talking about: \"Spare me your pathetic attempts at sarcasm. its just a matter of public record that organized Jewry are extremely influential in banking, the law, media and in politics. This is not a matter for debate its a demonstrable fact. Your lame attempts at playing the anti semitism card will fail. Its always the way with Zionists. They attempt to play the anto semitism card like an old man who forgets he has told the same war story a thousand times already.\" By now I'm beginning to feel a bit queasy really. Maybe I should just delete this whole thread and spare myself the bother. Maybe I, too, am the touchy, paranoid Jew? What is my point? (1) This is a collection of edited highlights of comments from people with different ideas and making different points. Not all are antisemites and not all are making the same points. I am interested in the shape of the discussion as a whole, not in making the case against any particular commenter. (2) Most of these commenters think of themselves as being on the left, whatever that might mean to them. (3) The comments box is a Guardian space, not a BNP space or a Jihadi Islamist space or a Daily Telegraph space. (4) The rhetoric of the \"Israel lobby\" lends itself very easily to anti-semitic conspiracy thinking. Mearsheimer and Walt have produced a poorly theorized, poorly argued piece of work that Jew-haters and idiots use as a Harvard stamp of approval for their paranoid fantasies. (5) Nearly all of the anti-semitic commenters misread Jonathan Freedland's piece (either on purpose or not). (6) Jonathan Freedland has, as anyone who reads the Guardian knows, a long record of opposing the policies of Israeli governments towards the Palestinians as well as the policies of Bush and Blair regarding the war in Iraq. Indeed, Freedland is a long time and public critic of the Blair premiership. NOTE FROM COMMENTISFREE: many of the above comments have been taken down for breaching our talk policy, and the posters have had their posting rights removed."

We can only, of course, provide you with reliable evidence for the third event of the week - step forward Sunny Hundal whose passionate critique of community politics and their leaders set the tone for a week of debate about race and faith, marking the 30th anniversary of the Race Relations Act. Apologies to those of you who stumbled upon the debate by accident and have posted around the site complaining that we're becoming obsessed. I did try to warn you. Personally I don't think it did completely dominate: all the pieces addressed different points and the debate that was provoked was generally very interesting. There are a few more contributions to come and Sunny will be back on in the next day or two to sum up (and to tell us how many signatories the manifesto attracted). We'll therefore keep the front-page banner for a bit longer to guide you to the debate if you still want to join in. There was actually a fourth conspiracy theory running round the site this week, speculating about the reasons for broken links, missing blogs and disappearing posts which dogged Cif and led to a flurry of angry posts and emails to us. Disappointingly, the answer turns out to be a combination of technical bugs and the application of the well-advertised talk policy. All complaints have been sent to the technical team, who are trying to sort out these issues as they arise - but please feel free to add others below. It helps if you can give detailed examples of exactly what has failed to work. I hope we can improve things next week. Perhaps I should write a manifesto."

    "title": "Newspaper spat over Madrid bombs 'conspiracy'",
    "content": "Spain's two largest newspapers, El País and El Mundo, have launched into a fierce row over their reporting of investigations into the Islamist train bombings that killed 191 Madrid commuters two and a half years ago. The outbreak of hostilities between the country's most influential dailies follows the publication in El Mundo of a series of interviews with a small-time Spanish crook accused of supplying the explosives used in the bombings. In the interviews José Emilio Suárez claims the bombings hid what was effectively a coup d'etat that brought the Socialist government of prime minister José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero to power. Mr Zapatero's Socialists won a national election three days after the Madrid bombings, ousting a People's party that had led in opinion polls published prior to the bombings. \"I am the victim of a coup they have tried to hide behind a bunch of muslims,\" Mr Suárez said. On Wednesday El País published part of a conversation between Mr Suárez and his parents - apparently recorded by authorities during a prison visit - which it claimed showed El Mundo had paid him. Socialist-supporting El País accused El Mundo of \"yellow\" journalism and stirring up conspiracy theories, including the idea that Basque group Eta may have been involved in the attacks. El Mundo yesterday denied paying Mr Suárez and claimed El País had taken his words out of context. In a widening of the media war, privately owned radio stations have taken sides. The conservative ABC newspaper, the third largest Madrid-based daily, has also attacked El Mundo. El Mundo has long been a critic of El País's powerful owner, the pro-socialist media magnate Jesús de Polanco, who owns TV, radio and publishing interests. The spat between the newspapers also reflected a continuing campaign by the People's party to cast doubt on the police investigation into the Madrid bombings. The campaign has split the People's party itself, as those close to former prime minister José María Aznar keep the conspiracy theories bubbling while other senior figures complain this damages the party's chances of re-election. \"There are more shadows than there is light in this case,\" the former minister Eduardo Zaplana said in parliament on Wednesday, claiming evidence appeared to have been hidden or falsified. The People's party mayor of Madrid, Alberto Ruiz-Gallardón, this week called on the party to leave the investigation to the police and courts and concentrate, instead, on criticising government policy. Mr Zapatero's government, meanwhile, accused the People's party of failing to get over its initial error in insisting the attacks had been carried out by the Basque terrorist group Eta. \"Once again we are being asked to explain what happened under a previous government,\" the interior minister, Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, told MPs He said the People's party was still trying to make people think Eta was behind the attacks while stoking fantasies about a socialist-led conspiracy. The People's party leader, Mariano Rajoy, denied promoting conspiracy theories, saying what he wanted was an investigation. Attack theories Eta Prime minister José María Aznar's government initially blamed Basque terrorist group Eta for the attacks but evidence soon pointed to Islamists. Fresh conspiracy theories now see Eta and the Islamists working together Morocco The bombers were mostly Moroccan. Spain had retaken, by force, an islet off the north African coast after it was occupied by Morocco. Conspiracy theorists think Moroccan intelligence services could have stopped the Madrid attack but chose not to Spanish police Did they deliberately hide or tamper with the evidence? Yes, say conspiracy theorists. If so, why? Socialists The Socialist party was the surprise winner of a general election three days after the attack. Surely, the conspiracy theorists say, there must be something there."

    "title": "Pakistan's role in uncovering conspiracy",
    "content": "Pakistan appears to have played a vital role in uncovering the terror plot, helping British security agencies to break the international network. Two or three suspects have been arrested by Pakistani authorities in recent days, but the Pakistan foreign ministry has refused to give details of their identities. It is understood they were \"local people\" who were arrested in Lahore and Karachi. An Islamic militant arrested near the Afghan-Pakistan border several weeks ago also provided a lead that played a role in \"unearthing the plot\", a Pakistani intelligence official said. Yesterday the founder of the Lashkar-e-Taiba militant group was put under house arrest in the eastern city of Lahore. Lashkar, an Islamic group fights for Kashmir's \"freedom\", was closed down in Pakistan after the September 11 attacks, but Hafiz Mohammad Saeed continued to run a religious charity called Jamaat-ud-Dawa. The US has designated both as terrorist organisations. On Tuesday Pakistani authorities had ordered hundreds of foreign students be expelled from madrassas. \"The major work was done by the British agents, but they got a major clue from Pakistan,\" he said. The information Pakistan obtained was \"quickly verified and shared\" with Britain, he added, and Pakistan had learned al-Qaida people \"while sitting in Afghanistan had discussed this plan.\" However even if those in police custody - most of whom are of Pakistani origin - did visit Pakistan for a few weeks, so do vast numbers of Britain's Pakistanis. The question is whether they met radical ideologues and organisations while there. Foreign ministry spokeswoman Tasnim Aslam said the arrests in Britain followed intelligence cooperation between Britain, Pakistan and the US. While Pakistan is a key ally of Britain and the US in the war on terrorism, it is also troubled by Islamic militancy on its own soil. Attention is likely to focus in coming days on Pakistan and the 13,000 madrassas or religious schools in the country. In the wake of the bombings of July 7 in London last year it was revealed that two of the London suicide bombers had been to Pakistan before the attacks, where one had visited a madrassa. At the time President Pervez Musharraf promised to crack down on foreigners attending the religious seminaries - some of which are known to provide an education rich in fundamentalist ideology."

    "title": "Polly Toynbee: CCTV conspiracy mania is a very middle-class disorder",
    "content": "The world is a dangerous place. A heating globe threatens drought, war and mass migration. Terrorists may blow up proliferating nuclear power stations. Ministers are preparing for a 1918-style flu pandemic. So on a scale of threats to Our Way of Life, where would you place CCTV and speed cameras, electronic health records, DNA storage or ID cards that carry the same information as passports? Most people are not in a delirium of alarm about the Big Brother potential of any of these. Mori finds that about 80% of people support the idea of ID cards (though only 39% think the government will introduce them smoothly, which is another matter). As for CCTV, when Mori asks local communities what would make their areas safer, street cameras always come in the top three. It's easy to see why: people on an estate I know say CCTV helped transform the only local shopping street, which had been rife with drugs and prostitution. Most journalists know those green-ink letters from psychotics begging you to investigate dark forces who have inserted a chip into their skulls as they slept or put microphones in their walls. It is no use urging them to listen to their psychiatrists, or telling them this is a common delusion with a medical cause and sometimes a cure: they just accuse you of joining the great conspiracy. It takes a delusion of some grandeur to imagine that an all-seeing eye really cares what you are up to every minute of the day. But it's one that seems to be shared by the vociferous campaigners against \"the surveillance society\". ID cards is the issue these fears coalesce around. Tony Blair made a robust defence of them yesterday at his monthly press conference, claiming they would curb illegal immigration, crime, terrorism, identity fraud and NHS tourism. Biometrics has to be introduced for passports anyway and the additional cost of ID cards carrying the same information is, he claims, small. Now all of that may be doubtful - when the cards are ready Blair will be long gone but criminals, terrorists and traffickers may be well ahead of the technology. The money might be better spent in myriad other ways, but the threat to fundamental civil liberties somehow eludes me. It is the job of the information commissioner to make his presence known from time to time, so last week he called for a public debate. We are waking up to the surveillance state, he said. Projecting forwards to 2016, he launched a report from the Surveillance Studies Network suggesting shoppers will be scanned, their clothes recognised by secret tags. Cars linked to satnavs will have mileage automatically debited while police monitor their speeds. Health and psychometric tests will determine who employers hire. Older people will be watched in their homes so relatives won't need to visit so often. Some of these scenarios are scary, but have nothing to do with surveillance. People failing to visit elderly relatives is sad, but hardly the fault of cameras. Employers already use daft and dangerous psychometric tests and can access too much information, but employment laws are what is needed to protect employment rights. As for drivers in peril for speeding, or congestion-charged for mileage, that's all to the good. And if Tesco knows what I buy, I am having trouble frightening myself. Certainly, the accuracy of information is vital - everyone needs the right to check and amend their records. But the chance of errors will be lessened, not increased, as technology advances. What about the DNA data bank? In principle, it is no more alarming than a more effective fingerprint database. If the objection is that thousands of the innocent have been logged, then why shouldn't everyone be on it? The gain in criminal detection is already clear; if there are fears then laws can protect against particular abuses. If - a big if - the medical records system ever works, it would be a huge blessing: lost records cause frequent chaos. Everyone will see and correct their records transparently, choose to opt out of some information-sharing and hide parts of their record. Unauthorised access will leave identifiable footprints. The new children's register is no threat either. The shocking discovery after the Victoria Climbié case that so many agencies had raised the alarm, but none knew about the others, makes it essential that concern is flagged up, with contact details of the person registering concern, but no details included for wider scrutiny. Big Brother is the malevolent use of surveillance by a wicked state. But for as long as the state remains democratic we can decide what use is made of it and how we are protected from possible abuses. To refuse to use technology for fear of some monstrous future government is paranoid. Those opposed to the assembling of data are mainly from the anti-state, individualistic right. There is a sad lack of voices to praise the benign state these days. Politicians are too mistrusted and civil-service unions too self-interested, so who else speaks up for the collective good of government? Conspiracy-theory, bad-state rhetoric has become the received opinion. The press fulminating against ID cards has less scruple about its own monstrous intrusions on privacy. The same Sunday Times that ran Rod Liddle's rant against surveillance also carried a shocking gossip-column item - a journalist had rummaged through David Miliband's rubbish bin looking at his papers. Press intrusion does a great deal more damage than our much scrutinised state. Surveillance conspiracy mania is a symptom of something else - the wish for the middle classes to be victims too. This is a middle-class obsession by those who are least likely to be surveyed. There is some decadence in paranoid speculation about imaginary abuses when real social injustice is all around. Why aren't people as angry about the galloping inequality in living standards between the 30% who will never own homes and the overpaid at the top who are fuelling property prices? Social mobility has come to a halt, crushed by this new era of mega-greed. Liberty is taking priority over equality, because it can arouse pleasing middle-class angst. There are real threats to some civil liberties - imprisonment without trial, acceptance of torture - but CCTV and ID cards are not among them. There is a moral blindness in pouring out so much righteous indignation over potential minor infractions against liberty while largely ignoring gross inequality. polly.toynbee@theguardian.com"
