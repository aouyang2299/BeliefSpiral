These include the theory that high-level government officials had advance knowledge of the attacks. Government investigations and independent reviews have rejected these theories. Proponents of these theories assert that there are inconsistencies in the commonly accepted version, or that there exists evidence that was ignored, concealed, or overlooked.\nThe most prominent conspiracy theory is that the collapse of the Twin Towers and 7 World Trade Center were the result of controlled demolitions rather than structural failure due to impact and fire. Another prominent belief is that the Pentagon was hit by a missile launched by elements from inside the U.S. government, or that hijacked planes were remotely controlled, or that a commercial airliner was allowed to do so via an effective stand-down of the American military. Possible motives claimed by conspiracy theorists for such actions include justifying the U.S. invasions of Afghanistan in 2001 and Iraq in 2003 (even though the U.S. government concluded Iraq was not involved in the attacks) to advance their geostrategic interests, such as plans to construct a natural gas pipeline through Afghanistan. Other conspiracy theories revolve around authorities having advance knowledge of the attacks and deliberately ignoring or assisting the attackers.\nThe National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the technology magazine Popular Mechanics have investigated and rejected the claims made by 9/11 conspiracy theorists. The 9/11 Commission and most of the civil engineering community accept that the impacts of jet aircraft at high speeds in combination with subsequent fires, not controlled demolition, led to the collapse of the Twin Towers, but some conspiracy theory groups, including Architects & Engineers for 9/11 Truth, disagree with the arguments made by NIST and Popular Mechanics.",

As part of efforts by Donald Trump and his campaign in the Trump–Ukraine scandal, which led to Trump's first impeachment, these falsehoods were spread in an attempt to damage Joe Biden's reputation and chances during the 2020 presidential campaign, and later in an effort to impeach him.\nJoe Biden followed State Department intentions when he withheld the loan guarantee to pressure Ukraine into removing the prosecutor, who was seen as corrupt and failing to clean up Ukrainian corruption, in accordance with the official and bipartisan policy of the United States, the European Union, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. A confidential informant told the FBI that Burisma's owner said he was coerced to pay bribes to both Bidens to ensure Shokin was fired, though the informant was indicted in 2024 on charges he had fabricated the account.\nUnited States intelligence community analysis released in March 2021 found that proxies of Russian intelligence promoted and laundered misleading or unsubstantiated narratives about the Bidens \"to US media organizations, US officials, and prominent US individuals, including some close to former President Trump and his administration.\" The New York Times reported in May 2021 that a federal criminal investigation was examining a possible role by current and former Ukrainian officials, including whether they used former Trump personal attorney Rudy Giuliani, who was the subject of a separate but related federal investigation, to spread unsubstantiated claims.\nA joint investigation by two Republican Senate committees released in September 2020 found no evidence of wrongdoing by Joe Biden.

Clinton ran as the Democratic Party's candidate for president, in which she became the first woman to win a presidential nomination by a major U.S. political party. Prior to running, Clinton served as the United States secretary of state in the administration of Barack Obama from 2009 to 2013, a U.S. senator representing New York from 2001 to 2009, and the first lady of the United States, as the wife of Bill Clinton, from 1993 to 2001. She was defeated in the general election by the Republican candidate, businessman Donald Trump.\nClinton announced her candidacy on April 12, 2015. Her main competitor in the Democratic primaries was Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, who ran as a more progressive candidate in the primary. Clinton became the presumptive nominee of the Democratic Party on June 6, 2016, having received the required number of delegates. On July 22, she announced Virginia Senator Tim Kaine as her running mate, and the two were formally nominated at the 2016 Democratic National Convention on July 26.\nClinton received the most support from middle aged and older voters, as well as from African-American, Latino and older female voters. She focused her platform on several issues, including expanding racial, LGBTQ, and women's rights, raising wages and ensuring equal pay for women, and improving healthcare. \nClinton lost the general election to Republican Donald Trump on November 9, 2016; she conceded the following day. Had Clinton been elected, she would have been the first female and first spouse of a president to serve as president of the United States.\nClinton's narrow and surprising losses in the blue wall states of Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin were considered key to her defeat, which she conceded the day after the election.",

Her body was discovered before dawn the following morning, on August 5. Monroe had been one of the most popular Hollywood stars during the 1950s and early 1960s, and was a top-billed actress for the preceding decade. Her films had grossed $200 million by the time of her death.\nMonroe had suffered from mental illness and substance abuse, and she had not completed a film since The Misfits, released on February 1, 1961, which was a box-office disappointment. Monroe had spent 1961 preoccupied with her various health problems, and in April 1962 had begun filming Something's Got to Give for 20th Century Fox, but the studio fired her in early June. Fox publicly blamed Monroe for the production's problems, and in the weeks preceding her death she had attempted to repair her public image by giving several interviews to high-profile publications. She also began negotiations with Fox on being re-hired for Something's Got to Give and for starring roles in other productions.\nMonroe spent the day of her death, August 4, at her home in Brentwood. She was accompanied at various times by publicist Patricia Newcomb, housekeeper Eunice Murray, photographer Lawrence Schiller, and psychiatrist Ralph Greenson. At Greenson's request, Murray stayed overnight to keep Monroe company. At approximately 3 a.m. on Sunday, August 5, Murray noticed that Monroe had locked herself in her bedroom and appeared unresponsive when she looked inside through a window. Murray alerted Greenson, who arrived soon after, entered the room by breaking a window, and found Monroe dead. Her death was officially ruled a probable suicide by the Los Angeles County coroner's office, based on information about her overdosing and being prone to mood swings and suicidal thoughts. \nDespite the coroner's findings, several conspiracy theories suggesting murder or accidental overdose have been proposed since the mid-1960s. Many of these involve U.S. president John F. Kennedy and his brother Robert F. Kennedy, as well as union leader Jimmy Hoffa and mob boss Sam Giancana. Because of the prevalence of these theories in the media, the office of the Los Angeles County District Attorney reviewed the case in 1982 but found no evidence to support them and did not disagree with the findings of the original investigation. However, the report conceded that \"factual discrepancies\" and \"unanswered questions\" remained in the case.",

Sarah Palin, former governor of Alaska and 2008 Republican vice presidential candidate, coined the term when she charged that proposed legislation would create a \"death panel\" of bureaucrats who would carry out triage, i.e. decide whether Americans—such as her elderly parents, or son with Down syndrome—were \"worthy of medical care\". Palin's claim has been referred to as the \"death panel myth\", as nothing in any proposed legislation would have led to individuals being judged to see if they were worthy of health care.\nPalin's spokesperson pointed to Section 1233 of bill HR 3200 which would have paid physicians for providing voluntary counseling to Medicare patients about living wills, advance directives, and end-of-life care options. Palin's claim was reported as false and criticized by the press, fact-checkers, academics, physicians, Democrats, and some Republicans. Some prominent Republicans backed Palin's statement. One poll showed that after it spread, about 85% of respondents were familiar with the charge and of those who were familiar with it, about 30% thought it was true. Owing to public concern, the provision to pay physicians for providing voluntary counseling was removed from the Senate bill and was not included in the law that was enacted, the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. In a 2011 statement, the American Society of Clinical Oncology bemoaned the politicization of the issue and said that the proposal should be revisited.\nFor 2009, \"death panel\" was named as PolitiFact's \"Lie of the Year\", one of FactCheck's \"whoppers\", and the most outrageous new term by the American Dialect Society.",

Initially HAARP was jointly funded by the U.S. Air Force, the U.S. Navy, the University of Alaska Fairbanks, and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). It was designed and built by BAE Advanced Technologies. Its original purpose was to analyze the ionosphere and investigate the potential for developing ionospheric enhancement technology for radio communications and surveillance. Since 2015 it has been operated by the University of Alaska Fairbanks.\nThe current working IRI was completed in 2007; its prime contractor was BAE Systems Advanced Technologies. As of 2008, HAARP had incurred around $250 million in tax-funded construction and operating costs. In May 2014, it was announced that the HAARP program would be permanently shut down later in the year. After discussions between the parties, ownership of the facility was transferred to the University of Alaska Fairbanks in August 2015.\nHAARP is a target of conspiracy theorists, who claim that it is capable of weather manipulation and mind control. Scientists and other critics point out that these claims fall well outside the abilities of the facility, and often outside the scope of current natural science.",

King was assassinated on the balcony of the Lorraine Motel, the day after giving his final speech \"I've Been to the Mountaintop\". Claims soon arose over suspect aspects of King's assassination and the controversial role of the assassin, James Earl Ray. Although his guilty plea eliminated the possibility of a trial before a jury, within days, Ray had recanted and claimed his confession was forced. Suspicions were further raised by the confirmation of illegal surveillance of King by the FBI and the CIA, and the FBI's attempt to allegedly prompt King to commit suicide.\nIn 1979, the United States House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) concluded that there was a likelihood of conspiracy in the assassination of King and that Ray may have served as a scapegoat. In 1999, a mixed-race jury at a Memphis civil suit reached a unanimous verdict that King was assassinated as a result of a conspiracy involving the U.S. government, a person named Raoul, among others. After the verdict, Coretta King said: \"There is abundant evidence of a major, high-level conspiracy in the assassination of my husband.\" The jury found the mafia and various local, state, and federal government agencies were \"deeply involved in the assassination. ...

While an autopsy performed on February 21 was inconclusive in determining the manner of Lam's death, the Los Angeles County Coroner's office subsequently ruled the death an accident with bipolar disorder being a significant contributing factor. \nGuests at the Stay on Main sued the hotel over the incident and Lam's parents filed a separate suit later that year; the latter was dismissed in 2015.

Certain species of frogs however, can spontaneously change sex in non-polluted waterways in response to changes in temperature.\nIn other animals, exposure to endocrine disruptors during gestation can interfere with prenatal hormones, and consequently the sex differentiation of the brains of their offspring. This has led some researchers to speculate about exposure to endocrine disruptors during human pregnancy, and if it has an effect on later sexual orientation or gender identity of offspring. This hypothesis requires further research.",

Although the belief that LGBTQ individuals are more likely to molest children has no basis in fact, this stereotype has existed for decades in the United States and Europe, dating back to before World War II.\nThe specific use of the term groomer as a slur to refer to LGBTQ people (particularly trans people and drag queens) became more prominent during partisan political campaigning in the 2020s, where it was often used to justify anti-LGBTQ curriculum bills. Despite originating with the far-right, the conspiracy theory regarding the supposed sexual grooming of children has been pushed by a growing number of mainstream conservatives, especially in the United States. The conspiracy theory has since spread among conservatives in other countries, including Australia, Canada, France, Ireland, New Zealand and the United Kingdom.\nThe Southern Poverty Law Center characterizes this trope as an anti-LGBTQ myth. Aja Romano labels these ideas a moral panic. There is no reliable evidence that sexual minorities are more likely to abuse children. Advocates for children's rights have protested that the conspiracy theories make it difficult for survivors of childhood sexual abuse to access resources and help.

Various American conservative and right-wing politicians and media personalities promoted the hoax in response to several school districts enacting protections for transgender students. Many news outlets, fact-checking websites, and academic researchers have debunked such claims, and officials from every school named by those promoting the hoax have verified that the accusations are false. The claims have been described as internet trolling, fearmongering, and anti-transgender rhetoric.\nThe hoax was reported in Prince Edward Island, Canada in October 2021 and initially thought to be a joke, but had to be formally disavowed as misinformation circulated on social media. Rumors spread to other Canadian provinces and schools. In the United States, popular media coverage of the hoax originally revolved around a school in Michigan in December 2021, but spread to schools in several other states. Ahead of the 2022 elections, several prominent American politicians and media personalities spread the hoax, including Representatives Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and Lauren Boebert of Colorado, Minnesota Republican gubernatorial nominee Scott Jensen, Colorado Republican gubernatorial nominee Heidi Ganahl, retired brigadier general and New Hampshire Republican US Senate nominee Don Bolduc, podcast host Joe Rogan (who later clarified there was no \"proof that they put a litter box\" in a particular school), Chaya Raichik of Libs of TikTok, and Christian talk show host Bill Cunningham. Several parents of school-age children have amplified the hoax on social media websites such as Facebook.\nThe hoax spread in North America largely as backlash against recognition of gender variance in schools, and in 2023 was repeated in Australia, Britain and New Zealand. Some conservative politicians and activists argued that protections for LGBTQ+ students in schools had \"gone too far\" and that litter box accommodations are what they might lead to next, despite there being no confirmed instances of schools providing litter boxes for students to defecate or urinate in, or planning to do so.",

    "summary": "Maine was a United States Navy ship that sank in Havana Harbor on 15 February 1898, contributing to the outbreak of the Spanish–American War in April. U.S. newspapers, engaging in yellow journalism to boost circulation, claimed that the Spanish were responsible for the ship's destruction. The phrase, \"Remember the Maine! To hell with Spain!\" became a rallying cry for action. Although the Maine explosion was not a direct cause, it served as a catalyst that accelerated the events leading up to the war.\nMaine is described as an armored cruiser or second-class battleship, depending on the source. Commissioned in 1886, she was the first U.S. Navy ship to be named after the state of Maine. Maine and its contemporary the battleship Texas were both represented as an advance in American warship design, reflecting the latest European naval developments. Both ships had two-gun turrets staggered en échelon, and full sailing masts were omitted due to the increased reliability of steam engines. Due to a protracted 9-year construction period, Maine and Texas were obsolete by the time of completion. Far more advanced vessels were either in service or nearing completion that year.\nMaine was sent to Havana Harbor to protect U.S. interests during the Cuban War of Independence. She exploded and sank on the evening of 15 February 1898, killing 268 sailors, or three-quarters of her crew. In 1898, a U.S. Navy board of inquiry ruled that the ship had been sunk by an external explosion from a mine. However, some U.S. Navy officers disagreed with the board, suggesting that the ship's magazines had been ignited by a spontaneous fire in a coal bunker. The coal used in Maine was bituminous, which is known for releasing firedamp, a mixture of gases composed primarily of flammable methane that is prone to spontaneous explosions. An investigation by Admiral Hyman Rickover in 1974 agreed with the coal fire hypothesis, penning a 1976 monograph that argued for this conclusion. The cause of her sinking remains a subject of debate.\nThe ship lay at the bottom of the harbor until 1911, when a cofferdam was built around it. The hull was patched up until the ship was afloat, then she was towed to sea and sunk. Maine now lies on the seabed 3,600 feet (1,100 m) below the surface. The ship's main mast is now a memorial in Arlington National Cemetery.",

    "summary": "McCarthyism, also known as the Second Red Scare, was the political repression and persecution of left-wing individuals and a campaign spreading fear of communist and Soviet influence on American institutions and of Soviet espionage in the United States during the late 1940s through the 1950s. After the mid-1950s, U.S. Senator Joseph McCarthy, who had spearheaded the campaign, gradually lost his public popularity and credibility after several of his accusations were found to be false. The U.S. Supreme Court under Chief Justice Earl Warren made a series of rulings on civil and political rights that overturned several key laws and legislative directives, and helped bring an end to the Second Red Scare. Historians have suggested since the 1980s that as McCarthy's involvement was less central than that of others, a different and more accurate term should be used instead that more accurately conveys the breadth of the phenomenon, and that the term McCarthyism is, in the modern day, outdated. Ellen Schrecker has suggested that Hooverism, after FBI Head J. Edgar Hoover, is more appropriate.\nWhat became known as the McCarthy era began before McCarthy's rise to national fame. Following the breakdown of the wartime East-West alliance with the Soviet Union, and with many remembering the First Red Scare, President Harry S. Truman signed an executive order in 1947 to screen federal employees for possible association with organizations deemed \"totalitarian, fascist, communist, or subversive\", or advocating \"to alter the form of Government of the United States by unconstitutional means.\" The following year, the Czechoslovak coup by the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia heightened concern in the West about Communist parties seizing power and the possibility of subversion. In 1949, a high-level State Department official was convicted of perjury in a case of espionage, and the Soviet Union tested a nuclear bomb. The Korean War started the next year, significantly raising tensions and fears of impending communist upheavals in the United States. In a speech in February 1950, McCarthy claimed to have a list of members of the Communist Party USA working in the State Department, which attracted substantial press attention, and the term McCarthyism was published for the first time in late March of that year in The Christian Science Monitor, along with a political cartoon by Herblock in The Washington Post. The term has since taken on a broader meaning, describing the excesses of similar efforts to crack down on alleged \"subversive\" elements. In the early 21st century, the term is used more generally to describe reckless and unsubstantiated accusations of treason and far-left extremism, along with demagogic personal attacks on the character and patriotism of political adversaries.\nThe primary targets for persecution were government employees, prominent figures in the entertainment industry, academics, left-wing politicians, and labor union activists. Suspicions were often given credence despite inconclusive and questionable evidence, and the level of threat posed by a person's real or supposed leftist associations and beliefs was often exaggerated. Many people suffered loss of employment and the destruction of their careers and livelihoods as a result of the crackdowns on suspected communists, and some were outright imprisoned. Most of these reprisals were initiated by trial verdicts that were later overturned, laws that were later struck down as unconstitutional, dismissals for reasons later declared illegal or actionable, and extra-judiciary procedures, such as informal blacklists by employers and public institutions, that would come into general disrepute, though by then many lives had been ruined. The most notable examples of McCarthyism include the investigations of alleged communists that were conducted by Senator McCarthy, and the hearings conducted by the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC).\nFollowing the end of the Cold War, unearthed documents revealed substantial Soviet spy activity in the United States, though many of the agents were never properly identified by Senator McCarthy.",

Although the term has not been used publicly by governments in an official policy context, there are some dissident beliefs about this appellation that are associated with nationalist conspiracy theories regarding alleged secret plans to undermine U.S. sovereignty.  Development of these routes is supported by the North American SuperCorridor Coalition as part of a NASCO Corridor.  These include Interstate 35 from Laredo, Texas to the Canadian border that downgrades to a non-freeway route ending at Thunder Bay, Ontario, and Interstate 29, a spur that also downgrades to a regular highway at the border and continues to Winnipeg, Manitoba.\nThe term is also sometimes used to describe some additional partly-built or proposed highways and supercorridors which are intended to connect the road systems of the three nations of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) trade bloc. Interstate 69, which runs from Port Huron, Michigan, near the US-Canada border, to western Kentucky, is one among them. Ontario Highway 402 and other motorways in the Windsor-Quebec City Corridor in Canada might be viewed as an extension of this NAFTA superhighway to the northeast. There is now not a single motorway that has been finished in the southwest, from western Kentucky to the Mexican border. While I-69 is being built, the main routes to Mexico currently consist of portions of US Routes 45 and 51 from Kentucky to western Tennessee, I-155 from Tennessee to Missouri, portions of Interstates 55 and 40 from Missouri to Arkansas, and I-30 from Arkansas to the Texas portion of I-35, the original Nafta Superhighway that runs south to the Mexican border at Laredo, Texas. The uncompleted section of I-69 south of Kentucky is expected to eventually continue southwestward to the Texas Gulf Coast. It will have a spur linking to the original Pan-American Highway route through Mexico to Laredo, and additional branches extending to the Mexican spurs that cross the border at Pharr, Texas, and Brownsville, Texas.\nThe CANAMEX Corridor is another major route that links the three NAFTA countries.  It includes Mexican Federal Highway 15, American I-19 and I-15, and Alberta highway 2. The route is sometimes referenced as part of the NAFTA superhighway concept, but it already has a name of its own.  In addition to the major north–south corridors that link the Canadian and Mexican borders, Interstate 94 is an important east–west inland freeway (not coast-to-coast like most of the other major east–west interstates) that directly or indirectly links the corridors.  I-94 starts near the CANAMEX Corridor in Montana (Interstate 90 bridges the gap thereby providing an indirect link) then follows a northerly route just south of the Canadian border to intersect fully with the I-29 and I-35 routes of the \"NAFTA Superhighway\".  Further east, it links Chicago and the Windsor-Quebec City Corridor that has its western terminus at the Port Huron border crossing.  The Canadian corridor is a de facto continuation of I-94 and I-96 to and from eastern Canada. It is also linked by I-94 to the Chicago-Kansas City Expressway that follows a more southerly route to and from I-35. The importance of the Port Huron border crossing is enhanced by the fact that I-69 connects to the Windsor-Quebec City Corridor at the same bridge as I-94.",

Barnard claimed that the proposals, which included replacing the income tax with a national sales tax, abolishing compound interest on secured loans, and returning to a bimetallic currency, would result in 0% inflation and a more stable economy. The proposals were never introduced before Congress.\nSince the early 2000s, NESARA has become better known as the subject of a cult-like conspiracy theory whose original promoter was Internet personality Shaini Candace Goodwin, better known as \"Dove of Oneness\". Goodwin, who appropriated the NESARA notions without Barnard's consent, claimed that the act was actually passed with additional provisions as the National Economic Security and Reformation Act, and then suppressed by the George W. Bush administration and the Supreme Court. Goodwin's conspiracy emails were translated into several languages and had a large following online. Adherents to the theory have also been using the name GESARA (standing either for  Global Economic Security and Recovery Act  or Global Economic Security and Reformation Act) in order to extend the proposed NESARA reforms outside the US and to the rest of the world.",

Obama had served as President of the United States from 2009 until 2017, when Trump succeeded him; Trump served as president until 2021 (first term), but he was re-elected in 2024. \nDuring key points of the 2020 campaign, including the Republican National Convention and both presidential debates, Trump frequently repeated this theory, claiming \"they spied on my campaign\" in reference to these allegations. The specific allegations of inappropriate politically motivated surveillance or \"spying\" all involve the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Crossfire Hurricane investigation of the Trump campaign and transition and their ties to Russia. No evidence has been found that legal surveillance, as part of Crossfire Hurricane, was at the direction of Obama, Obama administration political officials or improper deep state influence, or that the Steele dossier was used to launch the Russia probe, or that the surveillance was designed to surveil the Trump campaign and Trump White House transition team for political purposes.\nTrump has claimed that as part of Crossfire Hurricane, his \"wires\" at Trump Tower were wiretapped. This was refuted by Trump's own Justice Department. In addition, Trump has claimed that after the Crossfire Hurricane investigation recorded Michael Flynn's conversations with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak, Flynn was improperly \"unmasked\". This was also refuted by the Trump Justice Department. Specific actions undertaken by the FBI that have been highlighted include the use of an informant who met with Trump advisors Sam Clovis, George Papadopoulos, and Carter Page, as well as obtaining a FISA warrant to legally surveil Carter Page after he left the Trump campaign.\nThe Inspector General report on the Crossfire Hurricane investigation did not find evidence that \"political bias or improper motivation influenced the FBI's decision to seek FISA authority on Carter Page\", but did point out serious inconsistencies and improper procedures that were followed with regard to the obtaining of the warrants. The Inspector General wrote that his review \"found no evidence that the FBI attempted to place any\" FBI source in the Trump campaign. The review also \"found no evidence\" that the FBI had tried to \"recruit members of the Trump campaign\" to serve as their sources.

Cruz, a former student at the school, fled the scene on foot by blending in with other students and was arrested without incident approximately one hour and twenty minutes later in nearby Coral Springs. Police and prosecutors investigated \"a pattern of disciplinary issues and unnerving behavior\".\nThe incident is the deadliest mass shooting at a high school in U.S. history. The shooting came at a period of heightened public support for gun control that followed mass shootings in Paradise, Nevada, and in Sutherland Springs, Texas, in October and November 2017.\nStudents at Parkland founded Never Again MSD, an advocacy group that lobbies for gun control. On March 9, Governor Rick Scott signed a bill that implemented new restrictions to Florida's gun laws and also allowed for the arming of teachers who were properly trained and the hiring of more school resource officers.\nThe Broward County Sheriff's Office received widespread criticism for its handling of the police response, both for not following up on multiple warnings about Cruz despite a lengthy record of threatening behavior and for staying outside the school instead of immediately confronting him. This led to the resignations of several police officers who responded to the scene, and the removal of Sheriff Scott Israel. A commission appointed by then-Governor Scott to investigate the shooting condemned the police inaction and urged school districts across the state to adopt greater measures of security.\nOn October 20, 2021, Cruz pleaded guilty to all charges and apologized for his crimes. The prosecution sought the death penalty, and a four-month death penalty trial was expected to commence in January 2022. After suffering numerous delays, in part due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the trial commenced on July 18, 2022. On October 13, 2022, a jury unanimously agreed that Cruz was eligible for the death penalty, but deadlocked on whether it should be imposed, resulting in a recommendation to sentence him to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. On November 2, 2022, Cruz was sentenced to life without parole, in accordance with a Florida law requiring the court not to depart from the jury's recommendation. The unanimity required to impose the death penalty has since been overturned by a bill signed by Governor Ron DeSantis, partly as a result of Cruz's sentencing.",

Proponents perceived clues among elements of Beatles songs and cover artwork; clue-hunting proved infectious, and by October 1969 had become an international phenomenon. Rumours declined after Life published an interview with McCartney in November 1969. \nThe phenomenon was the subject of analysis in the fields of sociology, psychology and communications during the 1970s. McCartney parodied the hoax with the title and cover art of his 1993 live album, Paul Is Live.

Five workers required hospitalization, one of whom remained in an intensive care unit for two weeks. Ramirez herself died from complications related to her cancer shortly after arriving at the hospital.\nThe incident was initially considered to be a case of mass hysteria. An investigation by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory suggested that Ramirez had been self-administering dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as a pain treatment. The oxygen from the mask provided by paramedics during her transport to the hospital likely converted the DMSO into dimethyl sulfate (DMS), a highly toxic and carcinogenic alkylating agent. Although dimethyl sulfate has a very low vapor pressure at body temperature, it is believed to have transitioned to a gaseous state due to the vacuum inside the vacutainer. This is similar to how water boils at a lower temperature when exposed to low pressure.

The memo alleges that the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) \"may have relied on politically motivated or questionable sources\" to obtain a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrant in October 2016 and in three subsequent renewals on Trump adviser Carter Page in the early phases of the FBI's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections.\nNunes was the chairman of the  committee at the time and was a supporter of FISA surveillance extension. Former Trump campaign CEO and chief strategist Steve Bannon has described Nunes as Trump's second-strongest ally in Congress. In April 2017, Nunes stepped aside from chairing the House Intelligence Committee's Russia investigation while the House Ethics Committee conducted an inquiry into whether Nunes had violated applicable ethics rules with respect to his apparent secret coordination with White House officials. Nunes then began his own parallel secret investigation. The Ethics Committee investigation ended in December 2017, after which Nunes claimed that he had never recused himself.\nRepublican legislators who favored public release of the memo argued that the memo presents evidence that a group of politically biased FBI employees abused the FISA warrant process for the purpose of undermining the Donald Trump presidency. These congressmen alleged that there was excessive and improper dependence on the Steele dossier, which was funded in part by the Clinton campaign and Democratic National Committee, when the Justice Department applied to the FISA court to conduct electronic surveillance on Trump aide Carter Page during the course of the campaign. Political allies of Donald Trump attempted to use the memo to pivot attention away from the Special Counsel investigation of the Trump presidential campaign's role in Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections.  Prior to release of the memo, news media  reported that Trump told his associates that release of the memo would discredit the investigation.\nA social media campaign, under the hashtag #ReleaseTheMemo, emerged in mid-January 2018 to publicly release the memo despite some of its classified contents. Journalist and national security advocacy groups reported that Russian-linked bots on Twitter helped spread the controversial hashtag. Trump approved release of the Republican document over the objections of the FBI and the U.S. Intelligence Community. The FBI issued a rare statement expressing \"grave concerns\" about factual omissions and the accuracy of the memo. Within Congress, anticipation of the release of the memo sparked controversy, mainly along political lines. House Republicans released the memo on February 2, 2018.\nDemocrats on the House Intelligence Committee prepared a classified 10 page rebuttal of claims in the Nunes memo, which was initially blocked for release. After the Nunes memo was released to the public, the House Intelligence Committee voted unanimously to release the Democrats' memo. On February 9, Trump blocked release of the Democrats' memo, saying the committee should redact classified and sensitive material before releasing it to the public. A redacted version of the Democratic memo was ultimately released on February 24.",

The book purports to be a leaked report authored by a Special Study Group tasked by the Kennedy Administration with planning the transition from a wartime economy and assess the potential social impacts of a \"condition of general world peace.\" It details the group's analyses, which concludes that world peace could cause the United States to collapse; war, or some alternative external threat, is necessary for social stability, the Study Group finds, and recommends the establishment of \"a permanent War/Peace Research Agency\" to improve \"the effectiveness of [war's] major stabilizing functions\" and to plan substitutes for war should \"a viable general peace\" emerge. The book became a New York Times bestseller and has been translated into fifteen languages.",

The perpetrator, Adam Lanza, fatally shot his mother before murdering 20 students and six staff members at Sandy Hook Elementary School, and later committed suicide. A number of fringe figures have promoted conspiracy theories that doubt or dispute what occurred at Sandy Hook. Various conspiracy theorists have claimed, for example, that the massacre was actually orchestrated by the U.S. government as part of an elaborate plot to promote stricter gun control laws.\nThe more common conspiracy theory, adopted initially by James Fetzer, James Tracy, and others, and further popularized by Alex Jones, denied that the massacre actually occurred, asserting that it was faked. The massacre was described by Fetzer and Tracy as a classified training exercise involving members of federal and local law enforcement, the news media, and crisis actors, which they claim was modeled on Operation Closed Campus, an Iowa school-shooting drill that was canceled in 2011 amid threats and public outcry. Jones described the shooting incident as \"synthetic, completely fake with actors; in my view, manufactured [...] it just shows how bold they are that they clearly used actors.\"\nNo evidence supports the conspiracy theories, which make a number of implausible claims. Moreover, many Sandy Hook conspiracy theories contradict one another. A number of sources have published articles debunking various claims put forward by conspiracy theorists. In 2018, the parents of several children killed in the Sandy Hook shooting launched a lawsuit against Jones and other authors of conspiracy videos for defamation, accusing them of engaging in a campaign of \"false, cruel, and dangerous assertions\". In 2019, Jones reversed his stance and stated that the massacre was real.",

    "title": "Satanic panic",
    "summary": "The Satanic panic is a moral panic consisting of over 12,000 unsubstantiated cases of Satanic ritual abuse (SRA, sometimes known as ritual abuse, ritualistic abuse, organized abuse, or sadistic ritual abuse) starting in North America in the 1980s, spreading throughout many parts of the world by the late 1990s, and persisting today. The panic originated in 1980 with the publication of Michelle Remembers, a book co-written by Canadian psychiatrist Lawrence Pazder and his patient (and future wife), Michelle Smith, which used the controversial and now discredited practice of recovered-memory therapy to make claims about Satanic ritual abuse involving Smith. The allegations, which arose afterward throughout much of the United States, involved reports of physical and sexual abuse of people in the context of occult or Satanic rituals. Some allegations involve a conspiracy of a global Satanic cult that includes the wealthy and elite in which children are abducted or bred for human sacrifice, pornography, and prostitution.\nNearly every aspect of the ritual abuse is controversial, including its definition, the source of the allegations and proof thereof, testimonies of alleged victims, and court cases involving the allegations and criminal investigations. The panic affected lawyers, therapists, and social workers who handled allegations of child sexual abuse. Allegations initially brought together widely dissimilar groups, including religious fundamentalists, police investigators, child advocates, therapists, and clients in psychotherapy. The term satanic abuse was more common early on; this later became satanic ritual abuse and further secularized into simply ritual abuse. Over time, the accusations became more closely associated with dissociative identity disorder (then called multiple personality disorder) and anti-government conspiracy theories.\nInitial interest arose via the publicity campaign for Pazder's 1980 book Michelle Remembers, and it was sustained and popularized throughout the decade by coverage of the McMartin preschool trial. Testimonials, symptom lists, rumors, and techniques to investigate or uncover memories of SRA were disseminated through professional, popular, and religious conferences as well as through talk shows, sustaining and further spreading the moral panic throughout the United States and beyond. In some cases, allegations resulted in criminal trials with varying results; after seven years in court, the McMartin trial resulted in no convictions for any of the accused, while other cases resulted in lengthy sentences, some of which were later reversed. Scholarly interest in the topic slowly built, eventually resulting in the conclusion that the phenomenon was a moral panic, which, as one researcher put it in 2017, \"involved hundreds of accusations that devil-worshipping paedophiles were operating America's white middle-class suburban daycare centers.\"\nA 1994 article in the New York Times stated that: \"Of the more than 12,000 documented accusations nationwide, investigating police were not able to substantiate any allegations of organized cult abuse\".",

It examined links between Trump associates and Russian officials and spies and the relationship between Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump. It features investigative journalist John Sweeney, who journeyed to Russia, Ukraine, Lithuania, and the United States during the course of his research. Sweeney had prior experience on the subject matter, having interviewed Trump in 2013, and Putin in 2014. The film was directed by Matthew Hill, Tomiko Newson, and Nick Sturdee.\nThroughout the documentary, Sweeney interviews intelligence and security analysts including John E. McLaughlin and Malcolm Nance, individuals with prior ties to Putin such as Aleksandr Dugin, Trump adviser Roger Stone and Russian politician Konstantin Kosachev. The documentary analyzes potential damaging information about Trump from the Steele dossier, and assesses whether Russian intelligence has blackmail in the form of kompromat which they could use to manipulate him. The film describes Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections and discusses whether Russian cyberwarfare impacted the elections. Finally, the documentary posits how a potential fallout between Trump and Putin could impact worldwide national security.\nAfter the film's initial release, it was featured at the International Journalism Festival in Perugia, Italy, in April 2017. The Guardian selected the documentary among \"Monday's best TV\", and The National featured it as \"TV Pick of the Day\". The Times Union called the film's revelations, \"shocking and alarming\".

A second phase of the project, with an unannounced start date, will involve a similar excavation adjacent to the East Wing. Funds for the White House Big Dig were allocated by a congressional appropriation made in late 2001.\nDespite the utilitarian description of its purpose, the project came to be the object of intense media speculation. The Washington Post characterized the GSA description of the project as a \"nothing to see here story\" while The New York Times, citing an anonymous source, claimed it was \"security-related construction.\"  The Associated Press reported that a privacy screen was placed around the construction site for its duration and sub-contractors on the project were required to cover identifying marks or logos on their company vehicles, measures which it implied were unusual. ABC News, meanwhile, equated the construction project as a \"mystery\" on-par with \"what happened to the dinosaurs\".

Her death occurred two days after 6-year-old Max Shacknai, the son of her boyfriend Jonah Shacknai, had fallen from the staircase of the same property. At the time, he was in critical condition in the hospital. Rebecca and her then teenaged sister, Xena, were the only known people present at the time of Max's fall. Subsequently on July 16, 2011, Max Shacknai died of his injuries.\nSan Diego Sheriff Bill Gore announced on September 2, 2011, that Zahau's death was a suicide while the younger Shacknai's death had been ruled an accident, and that neither was the result of foul play.\nMembers of Zahau's family disputed this finding and filed a US$10 million (equivalent to $12.2 million in 2023) wrongful death lawsuit against numerous named and unnamed (listed as 50 generic \"Does\") defendants, before reducing their focus to Jonah Shacknai's brother Adam. In April 2018, having heard evidence which only had to meet the less stringent standards of a civil case, the jury in that civil trial found Adam Shacknai responsible for Zahau's death and awarded the Zahau family a judgment totaling $5.2 million (equivalent to $6.2 million in 2023).\nWithin two weeks of the conclusion of the civil trial, the San Diego County Sheriff's Office began a review of its investigation and resubmitted to the County of San Diego Medical Examiner's Department for it to further review. In November 2018, having reexamined all the evidence, and noting that the Zahau family refused to submit its supposed evidence to assist in the review, the Chief Medical Examiner reported that the extensive investigative findings had been \"correctly concluded\", and restated that the \"cause and manner of\" Zahau's death was suicide. The Zahau family, knowing that Adam Shacknai was appealing the civil judgment arguing procedural errors and juror misconduct, immediately launched a public relations campaign accusing the county officials of making an incorrect decision. In February 2019, prior to final arguments in Shacknai's appeal being presented to the judge, the Zahau family chose to enter a settlement for $0.6 million judgment (equivalent to $0.7 million in 2023), resulting in the civil case being dismissed with prejudice and vacating the original $5.2 million judgment.",
