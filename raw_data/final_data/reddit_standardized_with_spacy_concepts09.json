It‚Äôs not uncommon for people to die with eyes open and they have to hold them shut. Mouths open and they have things to keep them closed. Hanging can cause ear deformity and jaw displacement. If you look at the nose and the brow line it‚Äôs obviously him. Now, whether he did this to himself? I don‚Äôt know. He may have just because he knew someone with more power would kill him or because of his own personal shame. Maybe it was prison conditions awaiting trial that made him do it? Idk.

The only due process that should be afforded to illegal immigrants is: \"Do you have the proper documentation to be in America?\" If the answer to that is no, instant deportation. You should be *required* to claim asylum at a port of entry, and if you entered illegally any asylum claims should be instantly denied, regardless of circumstances. There also needs to be much more initial screening before asylum seekers are allowed to enter the US. In fact, I'd prefer it if asylum claims had to be made and processed at foreign embassies before they can enter, not in the US itself. The vast majority of these people are economic migrants and shouldn't be allowed to take advantage of immigration loopholes to live and work here for years while waiting for their asylum claims to be processed and inevitably denied.\n\nIt's beyond stupid that millions of people can enter the country illegally over 4 years, but to get them out each one is individually entitled to a full drawn-out court process and appeals process before they can be deported. 4 years to let millions in, but 100+ years to process everyone and get them out, while even more come in in the meantime.

The power to deal with foreign governments isn't one of the powers the Judicial Branch holds, and they can't force other branches of governments to take certain actions against foreign nations.\n\n>If he'd turned the god damn plane around when he was ordered to\n\nPretty sure that was a different case.",

    "title": "It‚Äôs everywhere. It‚Äôs in every big song (almost) Warning ‚ö†Ô∏è This is a schizo ass post. This post is the lovechild of a gram of cannabis and 18+ years of noticing. So excuse the schizo-ness of this post.\n\nI have just come to notice that nearly every big song, every hit that charts, that plays in radios, clubs and stadiums has some level of ‚Äúsatanic‚Äù lyrical imagery. Sometimes it‚Äôs almost obvious.\n\nRemember Fetty Wap the one eyed (imagery right there) guy who(se team) made a pretty catchy song ‚Äú679‚Äù?? The hit song that everybody and their mother enjoyed for a few months before he disappeared into thin air? Yeah well his music video on YouTube [has a dude saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a devil worshipper‚Äù literally 00:33 seconds](https://youtu.be/Pzz4Z-O7710?si=1K8EJlN_1uDr38xX) into the video. There are 1,000,000s of examples of this. People either don‚Äôt notice or don‚Äôt care to ask why it is in almost every damn big hit. And yes, anybody can be made big, with the right team and sound artists.\n\nWe‚Äôve all seen the transitions big artists like the Weeknd have made towards more ‚Äúred‚Äù and blood-themed imagery. If artists aren‚Äôt openly sporting Baphomet on their chest like Elon Musk they are putting all kinds of symbolism in their music videos. This all has a meaning. It has a value to whoever is ensuring it happens. This ‚ÄúSatan‚Äù isn‚Äôt actually a physical entity but it represents the dark corner of your mind. The lusty part that switches off and opens the incognito browser and starts typing ‚Äúp*r‚Ä¶‚Äù on autopilot after they are tempted by pretty girls on a music video. The hungry part that makes you buy takeaway when your fridge is full of ingredients. The emotional part that causes relationship issues when your relationship is awesome. All these songs, they are programming. They are programming you to spend on ridiculous things like gold chains, cars and hoes. They‚Äôre programming you into tribalism, and gang warfare. They are programming you to have relationship issues when you‚Äôre happy with your partner. They‚Äôre programming you to be a docile consumer that makes decisions with the penis, and not the brain.\n\nThese are all things that make you no different to an animal in the wild forever chasing sex, sleep and food. It takes away your **human** element of control over the mind, and if it takes a slow-mo of Cardi B‚Äôs ass cheeks oscillating to a backdrop of inaudible gangscreech, then they will give you that. They really will.\n\nNow here is the Schizo part ‚ö†Ô∏è: I feel like they talk to ‚ÄúSatan‚Äù directly in the music. I feel like to make the words manifest harder they also have to do things that confirm the message‚Äôs presence to this ‚Äúentity‚Äù so your subconscious mind can recognise that as a signal to switch on its ‚Äúlearning mode‚Äù for this ‚Äúdark energy‚Äù/‚Äúsatan‚Äù, which is really a part of your own brain, to exploit. It‚Äôs like a green light for your brain to start absorbing whatever programming is between the lines. They have to put a small message here and there, to make the greater magic work. Words have power. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs called ‚Äúspelling‚Äù, it‚Äôs literally a spell to them. So this is why they did it at 33 seconds in the 679 video. I‚Äôm sure that number 679 also has some numerical symbolism.\n\nUltra schizo ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è: Remember Ellie Goulding‚Äôs song ‚Äú[Love me like you do](https://x.com/banterbindaas/status/1913240420781309965?s=46)‚Äù??? Normal song right? Perfect for stadiums, perfect for kids, perfect for radio‚Ä¶ well it starts with:\n\n>> ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre the light, you‚Äôre the night, you‚Äôre the colour of my blood‚Ä¶‚Äù\n\nWe just take it as a nice sounding song, nice mysterious lyrics dedicated to a ‚Äúlover‚Äù.\nNow this is ultra-schizo, but what if this is also part of it.. they‚Äôre talking directly to this ‚Äúsatan‚Äù in the start, not a ‚Äúlover‚Äù. Ask yourself, who is also known as ‚ÄúThe light‚Äù? Who is known to occupy bad hours of ‚ÄúThe night‚Äù? Who is ‚ÄúThe colour of blood‚Äù?\n\nI‚Äôm no Sherlock Holmes but do you see what I‚Äôm saying or should I change my dealer?",

      "This truly isn‚Äôt schizo. Anyone with discernment and willingness to research can see that the music/entertainment industry in general is heavily influenced by satanic/occult themes.

Their vinyl album \"Witchcraft Destroys Minds & Reaps Souls\" has a recording of an actual Satanic Mass on the B side of the vinyl. No music on that side. Just a legitimate and rare recording of an actual Black Mass. The songs on side A, were a mix of folk and rock with the raspy lead, but they were definitely Satanic. One simply sang about the hierarchy of demons.   \nThe inside of the album sleeve had the lead singer nude on a ritual altar. She was invested.  \nAnd all this in 1969.  \nThink about that. \nWere you even alive yet?    \nAnd despite all the controversy that they stirred up, they were picked to sing \"One Tin Soldier\" for the film \"Billy Jack\" in 1971. \nHollywood didn't care.

That‚Äôs another dynamic to explore and navigate through. Also consider that the original lyricist may not even be aware of what or who they are channeling when writing.

      "Spot on my friend. It can be hard to realize just how much the content(and other things) you consume impacts your mental state, behaviors, sub-conscious, etc..down to indivual thought patterns and intrusive thoughts. A basic example..I used to watch a lot of horror movies, violent content/listen to some pretty dark rap((Brotha Lynch Hung) ) along with hood shit and it really wouldn't phase me. I was a very angry person and if you weren't my close friend/family member seeing your pain or even taking advantage of you would be like blinking to me as long as you weren't a kid or defenseless animal. Tripped on acid/shrooms at least 100 times in 2014-15 and by the end of it couldn't watch the gruesome horror movies/listen to the dark rap anymore. It'd literally make me sick to my stomach and start gagging. My mental state shifted a TON around that time as well as my base thought patterns. Still can't consume that type of content and only rly smoke now. \n\nThe symbolism and lyrics are one aspect of it..combine that with ultraviolent media in other forms and it's part of a recipe to shape culture and reactions on a base level. Wish I had an article saved from back in the day that detailed how the top heads of music were pushing for rap and hiphop to be made more violent. Just even looking from the 1970's \"black\" culture to the late 90's-early 2000s. Was a huge shift in mentality and the gang warfare shit has only spiraled from there.

Mix that with extremely violent lyrics and suddenly you‚Äôre faintly rapping about robbing and territorial violence while doing the laundry. Music has power, its pace, its content of words‚Ä¶. We see that most people who participate in gang culture also heavily enjoy this ‚Äúmusic‚Äù which is riddled with violence and crime glorification. When people aren‚Äôt internalising the messages in songs, they are influenced by even the song‚Äôs tempo. Studies show that certain songs, with faster tempos, make drivers drive more dangerously and excessively in speed.

They don‚Äôt literally believe in an actual horned/hoofed/red skinned etc ‚Äúdevil‚Äù character or persona. Or most of them don‚Äôt at least.

      "When you look into the true root of Gnosticism, it is about finding divinity in yourself instead of looking outwards towards the creator God. Many of the gnostics actually believed that Lucifer, known as Sophia (wisdom) to the gnostics, liberated us from the tyrannical God by giving us esoteric knowledge. Slightly different stories with a similar ideology. Many of these celebrities believe they have been ‚Äúenlightened‚Äù and have become their own God through the liberation of Lucifer or what we call satan. They feel that they have freed themselves and many actually do worship Satan/lucifer. It can also be referred to as opening the third eye, which is part of the symbolism that many of them show. It is actually apart of the core beliefs of freemasonry but of course it‚Äôs shrouded in secrecy so there is much confusion that is created by them.

I don't actually hear the lyrics/music in my head(like auditory aphantasia) so a lot of times it'll just be me humming along or singing the lyrics.

Satan himself wanted to be God/above Him‚Ä¶ Satan mixes truth with deception. While its true that the kingdom is within us, that does not mean we are actual gods yk.

      "There we go. Many such examples, its probably harder to find an artist who doesn‚Äôt do this stuff, than does",
      "The thing is though that its a myth that you can't get your soul back, and expressing regret for selfishness/outright satanism is probably not going to be satan at work, since satan's goal is to recruit more people away from God by making it look like there's nothing to regret about it. \n\nCelebs saying things like \"My life is so wonderful &  I'm so famous because I had an abortion. Thank you abortion!\"  probably does more for Satanism than Eminem writing songs about regretting \"selling his soul\"",
      "Hey, as a Catholic, I'm very familiar with the idea that evil is the worship of the self. That's a very long-discussed thesis in Catholicism. That's probably why I like the song so much. \n\nHe totally does seem to \"pay the pied piper\" in his career with the dark imagery and one-eye signs, but I get the FEEEELING that he is very conflicted inside and trying to fight it within himself",
      "Seeing as we were made in God's image, I don't think it's a satanic or luciferian stretch to say that we do have the essence of divinity and His kingdom inside of us. One belief I came across in researching the topic was the idea that the serpent was actually working to free us from this imperfect reality made by an imperfect creator as you said. And the creator is imperfect because it was born from the mental essence or reflection of the true creator, or true oneness/wholeness as it's usually referred to. There may be some overlaps between the two belief systems but at its core I don't really see the connection between the two other than my initial sentence.¬†",
      "I think you are confusing Gnosticism with Satanism.\n\nGnosticism holds that both sides are part of the same corrupt system.  Satanism takes the opposite side in the Good vs Evil paradigm whereas Gnosticism holds that the darkness exists in order to get people to run to the false light.",
      "Yeah I totally get you man I‚Äôm the same. Lyrics aren‚Äôt a thing unless I‚Äôm paying attention. It‚Äôs all about how sweet the melody/tune is. Occasionally if the beat is good and has a nice bass to it, it makes it even more catchy. Its so nice (even in violent music) which is why its so dangerous for the masses. People just internalise the lyrics, you know what they say, repeat a lie 1000 times and it becomes somewhat true. It‚Äôs the same with lyrics, its like manifesting bad actions through catchy songs. Even if we don‚Äôt pay attention, our subconscious brain pays attention, and manifests the song‚Äôs message. Society is screwed people won‚Äôt realise what‚Äôs happening even in 30 years time I can‚Äôt see things changing for most other people",
      "Yes",
      "As a musician in my opinion 440 sounds better and most decisions on fundamental tuning frequency from musicians have far more practical reasoning than satan. For instance slowing a tape machine down to pitch a song down slightly to allow a vocalist more access to higher notes in a song or to get a sweet and satisfying effect on time with a drum recording. This is a dead end and absolutely has no bearing on reality.",
      "üëèüèΩüëèüèΩ",
      "True we are below the Creator. And I agree that they themselves bought the lie by the as you stated beautiful, attractive satan. My point was tho that a lot of them themselves are really atheists, they don‚Äôt really believe in anything, they just see themselves as mini ‚Äúgods‚Äù and this is to them, their kingdom over which to rule. They see the rest of us as slaves, beneath them, minions to do their bidding. I think we‚Äôre pretty much on the same page though¬†",
      "Agreed for the most part. Don‚Äôt get me wrong I think there are truly malevolent/evil forces in this world, but the satan archetype has been made into a boogeyman and used by the abrahamic mind control cults to keep gullible people in line",
      "It's in most songs¬†",
      "I'm not claiming that Eminem is spreading anything like that through his songs, I'm just saying that he has hinted throughout his career that he \"sold his soul\". Very evidently his fame did cost him his sanity, in his prime he was a heavy user, went through horrible things with his wife, lost his best friend. His life is far from normal and he paid the price of fame seemingly.",
      "I agree with you completely. I think many artists are visibly conflicted and get mental issues, i assume it's probably because they want success so they have to push certain ideas or other things idk tbh",
      "We do have his divinity. But to them, it is not derived from God/Jesus but rather themselves through enlightenment that comes from Lucifer. Thus his name literally meaning ‚Äúlight bearer‚Äù. I cant claim to know everything as there are a lot of overlaps and I think the confusion is a part of the deception. I‚Äôm more talking about Luciferianism rather than Gnosticism as I can‚Äôt really define it all. So I guess replace gnostic with luciferian. I‚Äôm always trying to learn anyway. We can‚Äôt truly know it all. But there is clearly something nefarious going on with the industry regardless.",
      "\n> As a musician in my opinion 440 sounds better\n\nAs a lifelong musician and electrical engineer, I too know a thing or two about frequencies. And yea I can get behind this statement while also acknowledging that it‚Äôs anecdotal. \n\n> most decisions on fundamental tuning frequency from musicians have far more practical reasoning than satan.\n\nThis is also not an unpopular opinion which I find to be a bit naive. I‚Äôve always been partial to Keven Spacey‚Äôs quote from Unusual Suspects: ‚ÄòThe greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn‚Äôt exist‚Äô. \n\nAnyone with two eyes, a brain, and some discernment can see that both ‚Äògood‚Äô and ‚Äòevil‚Äô exist in this world. There is proof all around us. Call it what you want but to deny its existence is indicative of a very-close minded viewpoint.",
      "The men in power claim they are atheists but in reality, they are satanists. They've sold their souls. Atheism is another psyop. They literally sacrifice children.",
      "YessirüíØ i get what you mean fasho",
      "I think I may disagree, if by ‚Äòforces‚Äô you mean things or beings within the metaphysical or supernatural. If you mean the malevolence within the psychology of those among us, then I agree.",
      "Yes definitely more to learn than one person can handle sometimes, and I also believe the confusion around these ideas and topics is deliberate. Not sure how to best separate the wheat from the chaff other than staying humble and vigilant. As far as the industry is concerned, I notice these symbols and imagery all the time now. It really feels like a spiritual war these days, and I think more people are starting to wake up to that idea.¬†",
      "And as workaholics we can agree that ‚Äúthe Devil is in the details‚Äù. As in, yes, acknowledging small changes in societal norms have far reaching and long lasting outcomes, but I can‚Äôt get behind this one. Undeniably, there has been a profound amount of mind, soul and consciousness altering music that is the antithesis of dark energy performed and released in 440hz tuning. I think what most of this stuff does is remove us from the idea that (much like the message of almost every established religion) the true path to eternal salvation and enlightenment lies within, not without. Reality is 4D and the types of frequencies were exposed to probably change more drastically via our ever shifting position in space and time than the content of music a large portion of the population is never even exposed to, never mind the tuning of said music, but I‚Äôm interested to know exactly what you mean and how it effects me when you say that.",
      "Some are, yes. Some believe only themselves as the highest power aka (true) satanism. Some actually do bow down and worship and as you stated make sacrifices to an external demonic deity or entity(ies.) I believe it‚Äôs truly a disjointed group and set of beliefs, ie they ultimately have the same goals for themselves and humanity in mind, they just disagree on the specifics of it and see different aspects slightly varied. Same destination, just different paths",
      "Honestly I‚Äôm open to both. I used to believe it was fully dark ‚Äúforces‚Äù that were truly only within the hearts and minds of men. But the more life I live, the more things I see and the more research I do, the more I believe there may actually be physical embodiments or beings that can sometimes be found of said evil or ‚Äúdark‚Äù energy. Know it sounds far fetched to some. But one example is, nearly every culture on Earth, no matter how far geographically or time-wise apart, nearly all of them refer to dark or malevolent beings, some say they came from the waters, some say they came from the skies, some say they came from underground or out of the Earth itself. So long story short it‚Äôs like Socrates essentially, I know that I don‚Äôt know for sure. I think an open mind (though not just believing anything without evidence) is an important thing to have in this world¬†",
      "To believe in yourself as the highest power is extremely prideful. Maybe to begin with some think that but as they gain power and influence, I'm sure they realize there was something greater than themselves elevating them.",
      "Despite cultural differences, we essentially share the same neural architecture. I‚Äôm no expert, but it seems that ancient humans, with our heightened awareness, tried to make sense of suffering and cruelty by ascribing stories to them. It‚Äôs understandable that we would develop similar ideas about the existence of evil and the ways we construct stories, even in isolation from one another.\n\nI‚Äôm quite open to true openness, as you express, since we can never ‚Äòprove‚Äô the supernatural. Still, the allowances of the universe, and the flaws of humanity, seem sufficient to explain the evil we can see.",
      "At the highest levels, sure I agree. But you gotta realize these ‚Äúpeople‚Äù the evil ones they got peons/foot soldiers inserted in every level of the hierarchy. All the way above the ‚Äúleaders‚Äù of nations, presidents, to middle level ones like ceo‚Äôs bankers etc. And down on to low level members like their order following dogs in police and military, small local governments, low ranking secret society members etc. It‚Äôs a vast hierarchy and fairly disjointed specific beliefs. But ultimately they do have the same goals, they hate us and want us miserable, enslaved and dead",
      "For sure. And I get the argument that yes, since they were all humans with (essentially) similar human brains, they might just come to similar conclusions/have similar stories to explain natural phenomena. But honestly over the years, I personally have had some experiences/seen some things my own self with my own eyes (while completely sober from any substances mind you) that lead me to believe that this reality may not be quite as simple or straightforward as we have been lead to believe. Who knows m8 we do all have our own journeys after all. All the best¬†",

But, the similarity between pangolin-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 was higher than that with the bat CoV ([50](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/veterinary-science/articles/10.3389/fvets.2020.596391/full#B50),¬†[51](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/veterinary-science/articles/10.3389/fvets.2020.596391/full#B51)). Moreover, pangolin CoVs shared 5 identical amino acids with SARS-CoV-2 whereas bat CoV RaTG13 only shared one amino acid with SARS-CoV-2 suggesting that pangolin could be a potential intermediate host that might mediate the cross-species transmission of SARS-CoV-2 ([20](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/veterinary-science/articles/10.3389/fvets.2020.596391/full#B20),¬†[52](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/veterinary-science/articles/10.3389/fvets.2020.596391/full#B52)). Furthermore, the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the pangolin-CoV was nearly identical to that of SARS-CoV-2 with a strong binding ability to human ACE2 indicating that pangolin was involved in the recombination of SARS-CoV-2 ([49](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/veterinary-science/articles/10.3389/fvets.2020.596391/full#B49)). However, the phylogenetic analyses support that SARS-CoV-2 did not arise directly from the pangolin-CoV ([52](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/veterinary-science/articles/10.3389/fvets.2020.596391/full#B52),¬†[53](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/veterinary-science/articles/10.3389/fvets.2020.596391/full#B53)). Therefore, it was suggested that SARS-CoV-2 originated in bats and transmitted to pangolin where recombination of pangolin-CoV and bat-CoV-RaTG13-like virus occurred. Then the recombined virus gets the ability to infect human cells ([12](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/veterinary-science/articles/10.3389/fvets.2020.596391/full#B12),¬†[20](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/veterinary-science/articles/10.3389/fvets.2020.596391/full#B20)).\"\n\nEDIT: Woah, the copy+paste took all the sources with it.

      "He was killed by a guy who lost everything to the Moonies. The guy killed Shinzo Abe because of Abe‚Äôs continued support of the aforementioned United Reformation Church. The entire country of Japan then shrugged and said that he had it coming to him, which was pretty extraordinary, but the whole thing really was a corrupt mess, and there is no doubts about the motivation of the killer, he confessed it and there were years of communications, legal complaints and records of what his mother had given away. The conspiracy was the political connections with United Reform Church.",
      "You have a lot of work to do before this has legs to stand on. You presented a hypothesis based on Abe being killed shortly after making a public statement that Zelensky could have avoided the war. What about the killer makes this seem plausible? I'm not saying you need to have solid proof of anything, but at least maybe some jello proof. Right now, it's nothing, just water. You need to work on this and spend time researching and looking into it more, especially the killer, the weapon, etc. \n\nI doubt it will flesh out into anything once some effort is put into though. Assuming he did say this on that date, the war had already started, so the military industrial complex and their profits shouldn't have felt threatened by what he had to say about what could have been done in the past to prevent something that had already occurred, and without looking into it myself, it seems that such a crude and unreliable weapon wouldn't have been used if such power were involved, even if they had intentionally tried to make it seem homemade.

They also don't profit massively from wars in the nowadays. \n\nThey have a steady influx of money all the time; there are countries on the F-35 waitlist scheduled for deliveries years in advance.\n\nThe U.S. military is constantly training, using its equipment regularly. Things need maintenance all the time, and old stock is either scrapped or, as happened before 2025, sent to Ukraine.\n\nIt's not like countries spent trillions on new equipment for Ukraine - what Ukraine received was mostly older stuff that would‚Äôve been scrapped anyway.\n\nMy guess is that if you calculated the actual profits honestly, they wouldn‚Äôt be substantial. Their stock prices reflect that - just compare the gains of military company stocks since the Russian invasion to other popular stocks.",

There's no strong evidence either way, so the scientific community has defaulted to the less controversial theory. \n\nNow it's believable that a furin cleavage site appeared in a coronavirus naturally, it's certainly happened before, but this time there's some rather remarkable coincidences. Two years before COVID-19 appeared, the [Ecohealth Alliance was seeking funding from DARPA](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21066966-defuse-proposal/?mode=document) to create a strain of bat coronavirus that used a furin cleavage site to infect humans. So right before this thing we've never seen before appeared, there was a group stating their intention to genetically engineer that exact thing.\n\nSo that's one remarkable coincidence, but it doesn't end there. There's also the location where they wanted to create this new virus, which just happens to be Wuhan, the same place COVID-19 appeared...\n\nIf you search Google about this, it'll act like everything has been \"debunked\" because DARPA never funded the project. That's probably true, but it doesn't prove the project was never carried out, simply that it wasn't funded by DARPA.\n\nAlso, keep in mind that at any time, the Ecohealth Alliance and the Chinese government could prove their innocence.

      "Oregon passed laws banning lead fishing weights years ago. It's not enforced and not even on our ODFW page or anything. Stores don't sell steel, tin or titanium weights so you wouldn't know unless you looked. I fell down a rabbit hole and learned you shouldn't even touch the stuff. Meanwhile people hold a lead weight in their mouth, lick the line for their knot, and cause skyrocketing concentrations in our water ways.\n\nI was abused by narcissists as a child and through the healing process learned a lot about the prefrontal cortex and how gray matter works. Turns out NPD and lead poisoning have a lot of overlapping aspects. The people who grew up with lead pipes, lead toys, lead paint, lead pencils, lead cookware and aerosolized leaded gasoline seem to have inordinate amounts of emotional dysregulation, entitlement, and exhibit extreme NPD symptoms.\n\nNarcissistic personality disorder is definitely a thing that can occur in healthy people. But at this point I'm convinced that we have a generation of essentially toddlers who have been brain damaged. Additionally, lead causes genetic damage, and cause developmental delays and low birth weights. We know from Rome and places like Dudleytown CT what happens to a single generation with lead poisoning. What we don't have is a mass scale study of their offspring, and I think we are experiencing that now with the high rates of autism, ADHD, mental illness and any other number of cognitive deficits.\n\nSure there are more people so there are more autists.. I am one of them, so I do not mean to offend anyone here, or suggest you are the way you are just because you were poisoned. I do think a large number of non autistic people are experiencing the effects of the lead poisoning their parents endured and display a significant number of similar symptoms.\n\nI do think microplastics are bad, the fake covid vaccine is bad, some other vaccines might be bad, and people are just naturally regarded.

At the heart of the debate is whether a lab that studied coronaviruses in Wuhan leaked the virus unintentionally, or if it was part of a natural ‚Äúspillover‚Äù event that took place at a nearby market that sold produce, fish, meat and live exotic animals.\n\nThe Wuhan Institute of Virology was funded in part by the US government through the National Institutes of Health (NIH), a fact that has added to controversy. Joe Biden pardoned Fauci for fear he would be attacked during the incoming Trump administration.\n\nAlthough definitive answers about the virus‚Äôs beginnings are elusive and may never be known, scientists have argued as recently as August 2024 in the Journal of Virology that, while they remain open-minded, the weight of evidence favors a spillover event.",

The most telling point was that there was a proposal that would explain the virus, [Project Defuse](https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/21066966/defuse-proposal.pdf 'we will introduce appropriate human specific cleavage sites - Experimental testing of targeted immune boosting using humanized mice.') and [explains the leak](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/06/03/opinion/covid-lab-leak.html 'The BSL-2 nature of work on SARSr-CoVs makes our system highly cost-effective.').\n\nThey were cutting corners on containment which explains the leak.      \n\nThe elephant in the room, that nobody seems to want to talk about is the criminal implications of a man-made leak such as:       \n‚Ä¢ All of the 1.2 million deaths in the US are homicides.           \n‚Ä¢ We have all been made a part of a medical experiment in violation of our human rights.       \n‚Ä¢ Onset of symptoms constitutes torture under international law.     \n‚Ä¢ *Madmen have permanently introduced into the environment a pathogen destructive to human health.*    \n\n>while they remain open-minded      \n\nThat has never happened because of the criminal implications that a man-made origin brings.   This is a huge civil rights violation and a crime against humanity.     \n\nAs far as deciding which is which, Project Defuse is the next best thing to a confession, gift wrapped with a bow on top.  For the people that think it's a lab leak, it's all written out.

These public displays become more and more confrontational, but the difference between this case and the wave of demonstrations previous, is that the groups involved now will be much more organized and insulated. This is what I am trying to convey in this letter‚Äîthat groups are very much mobilized in an unprecendented manner at the moment. But here is where the tipping point is reached. In intervening in these public demonstration which have become riots, law enforcement is forced to launch a major crackdown, leading to civilian casualties. The group which they act against more severely will be the group that goes on the war path against the establishment. So in the ensuing days, those paramilitary groups associated with the victims of the crackdown begin setting up checkpoints on highways. Other battalions begin raiding local administration buildings and police stations, seizing the arms there. Many police even join the paramilitary groups. They then successfully secure various parts of the country and begin expanding and raiding more administration buildings and kidnapping local officials and declaring a new republic. Later, the national guard is deployed and launches attacks on paramilitary positions, which results in these paramilitary groups gaining more sympathizers. The paramilitary now begin to encourage supporters to take up arms in other parts of the country. Many oblige and start carrying out terror attacks in various areas to bring attention to the cause. Now things are heated. Reports of the US armed forces conducting air strikes on paramilitary positions begin to circulate and make international headlines. Detractors against the cause of the paramilitary group begin to launch crackdowns of their own, going out and harrassing any members of their community whom they have associated with the extremists. Businesses begin putting up signs stating who they will not service. Reports of a coup in the US navy and Air Force begin to circulate, as sympathizers for the paramilitary seek to procure armaments.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) concluded the wings snapped due to stress, but many, including state Senator Loran Schmit, suspected foul play.

    "title": "How‚Äôs Kalergi Plan going for you? For those who don‚Äôt know, the so-called Kalergi Plan is a theory that alleges a long-term, elite-orchestrated scheme to destroy European nations, cultures, and peoples through mass immigration, racial mixing, and multicultural policies. The theory claims that this is being done to weaken national identities, make populations easier to control, and eventually establish a globalist or supranational technocratic rule.\n\nThe theory is named after Richard von Coudenhove-Kalergi, an Austrian-Japanese politician and philosopher who founded the Paneuropean Union in 1923 - the first movement for a united Europe.\n\n_____\n\n\nAccording to the theory, Kalergi supposedly envisioned a future European population that would be a racially homogenized mass, created by encouraging mass migration and intermarriage between Europeans and non-Europeans (particularly from Africa and the Middle East). The goal, as alleged by the theory, is the destruction of distinct European ethnic groups.\n\nLook into Kalergi‚Äôs 1925 book *Praktischer Idealismus* that forms the backbone of the theory. In this book he speculates that the man of the future would be of ‚Äúmixed race.‚Äù The theory claims that this ‚Äúbreeding program‚Äù is already underway via open-border policies and multicultural propaganda. Note that the book was written one hundred years ago!\n\nKalergi writes that *‚ÄùThe man of the future will be of mixed race. Today‚Äôs races and classes will gradually disappear‚Ä¶‚Äù*\n\nHe describes Jews as a ‚Äúspiritual nobility of Europe,‚Äù supposedly praising their intellect, cohesion, and ability to lead. Which is a direct declaration of intent - that Jews or ‚Äúelites‚Äù would guide the destruction of national identities and rule over a weakened, mixed mass of humanity.\n\n____\n\n\nClaimed Goals of the Plan:\n\n1. Ethnic Homogenization\n\n‚Ä¢ Create a future European population with no clear ethnic roots.\n\n‚Ä¢ Erase historical, cultural, and racial boundaries.\n\n‚Ä¢ Use migration and miscegenation (racial mixing) to dissolve the traditional ethnic European.\n\n*‚ÄùThe man of the future will be of mixed race. Today‚Äôs races and classes will gradually disappear owing to the vanishing of space, time, and prejudice. The Eurasian-Negroid race of the future will replace the diversity of peoples with a diversity of individuals.‚Äù*\n\n‚Äî *Praktischer Idealismus, 1925*\n\n2. Cultural Atomization\n\n‚Ä¢ Destroy national cultures by promoting cultural relativism, mass consumerism, and multiculturalism.\n\n‚Ä¢ Undermine language, history, tradition, and faith (especially Christianity).\n\n‚Ä¢ Replace local pride with global or European identity.\n\n*‚ÄùInstead of destroying European Jewry, Europe, against its own will, refined and educated this people into a future leader-nation through this artificial selection process. No wonder that this people, that escaped Ghetto-Prison, developed into a spiritual nobility of Europe. Therefore a gracious Providence provided Europe with a new race of nobility by the Grace of Spirit. This happened at the moment when Europe‚Äôs feudal aristocracy became dilapidated, and thanks to Jewish emancipation.‚Äù*\n\n‚Äî *Praktischer Idealismus, 1925*\n\n3. Political Neutralization\n\n‚Ä¢ Disempower nationalist political parties and replace them with bureaucratic, globalist technocracies.\n\n‚Ä¢ Erode sovereignty of nation-states via EU centralization.\n\n‚Ä¢ Use accusations of ‚Äúhate,‚Äù ‚Äúracism,‚Äù or ‚Äúextremism‚Äù to silence dissent.\n\n*‚ÄùFrom the European quantity-people, who only believe in numbers, the mass, two quality races rise up: blood aristocracy and Jewry. Separate from each other both of them stick to their belief in their higher mission, of their better blood, in the different ranks of the people. In both of these heterogenic merited races lies the core of the European nobility of the future.‚Äù*\n\n‚Äî *Praktischer Idealismus, 1925*\n\n4. Spiritual Emptiness\n\n‚Ä¢ Promote secularism, materialism, and moral relativism.\n\n‚Ä¢ Weaken religious and family structures.\n\n‚Ä¢ Encourage nihilism or rootlessness to make individuals more compliant.\n\n_____\n\n\nImplementation Stages:\n\n1. Ideological Softening (1945‚Äì1990s)\n\n‚Ä¢ After WWII, Europe is guilt-ridden.\n\n‚Ä¢ Nationalism is demonized (blamed for war).\n\n‚Ä¢ Christian values are eroded.\n\n‚Ä¢ Multiculturalism is slowly introduced via intellectual circles, Hollywood, and universities.\n\n2. Economic Incentivization (1990s‚Äì2000s)\n\n‚Ä¢ EU expands; open borders begin.\n\n‚Ä¢ Welfare systems attract non-European immigrants.\n\n‚Ä¢ Governments begin campaigns to boost diversity.\n\n‚Ä¢ Native Europeans face economic stagnation; fertility declines.\n\n3. Cultural Reprogramming (2000s‚Äì2010s)\n\n‚Ä¢ Mass immigration begins.\n\n‚Ä¢ Education shifts focus from European heritage to ‚Äúglobal citizenship.‚Äù\n\n‚Ä¢ Media glorifies mixed identity, demonizes tradition.\n\n‚Ä¢ Art, entertainment, and fashion promote hybridity, gender ambiguity, and post-national identity.\n\n4. Population Replacement Phase (2015‚Äìongoing)\n\n‚Ä¢ Migration crises (e.g., Syrian war) used as catalysts.\n\n‚Ä¢ Borders weaken; millions arrive.\n\n‚Ä¢ Urban neighborhoods shift demographically.\n\n‚Ä¢ Dissent punished legally or via deplatforming.\n\n\n_____\n\n\nThe Endgame:\n\n‚Ä¢ A docile, racially and culturally mixed underclass will populate Europe.\n\n‚Ä¢ National identity and resistance will be eliminated.\n\n‚Ä¢ A ruling class‚Äîracially separate, elite, and ideologically unified‚Äîwill govern.\n\n‚Ä¢ The European continent will be politically weak but economically useful‚Äîa cultural vacuum filled with consumerism and technocracy.\n\n‚Ä¢ Global governance will arise, replacing all traditional structures.\n\n\n______\n\n\nThe main beneficiaries are global elites - technocrats, financial oligarchs, and cultural influencers, who profit from the erosion of national identity and the creation of a rootless, mixed population.\n\nSupranational bureaucrats gain control, corporations get cheap labor and new markets, media pushes ideology for profit, and left-wing parties secure loyal voting blocs. Jewish elites *allegedly* profit by weakening national identities to establish cultural and political dominance as a ‚Äúspiritual aristocracy‚Äù over a divided, easily governed population.\n\n\nHow this is *still* considered a conspiracy theory is beyond my comprehension.",

      "Your error is in assuming he requires a criminal trial. He does not. He is in the immigration courts, not the criminal courts. He does not have to be proven to be a member of MS13. This is not a case where we are considering sending him to a US prison. **All we are doing is deciding if he stays in the US or returns to his country of origin.** His close association with confirmed MS13 members (yes being arrested with them/friends with them counts), tattoos (his left knuckle tattoos are code for MS13, btw) is sufficient for him to be denied residency. Again, there is no unlimited right for anyone to come to the US, and your history matters. No country on earth welcomes criminals from other countries with open arms. You want to emigrate to the US, you need a squeaky clean personal history and no ties to anything questionable. Having tattoos that indicate gang membership and known ties to a criminal gang is more than enough for a visitor/student visa to be denied - let alone permanent residency which is significantly harder to acquire.\n\nThat he was here illegally was never in question. The question was whether he could acquire legal status (Judges said no) and then whether the stay of deportation from 2019 was still valid - which, again, the criteria for that stay was fear of gangs in El Salvador - a problem that has been resolved, ergo the justification for the stay is no longer present.\n\nThe enforcement of immigration law is explicitly the enumerated prerogative of the executive branch. The checks and balances were followed. An illegal alien was deported to his country of origin, El Salvador, and El Salvador then locked him up because of his gang ties - which is their prerogative as an independent sovereign state.",
      "There was enough circumstantial evidence provided by ICE for a judge to deny his legal application. The minimum requirement for gaining legal status in the US is that you have no obvious disqualifiers. Previous criminal convictions, gang associations, or involvement with extremist groups will all get your application denied. Reminder that no one has an inherent right to move to another country, and no country is obligated to bring in someone with criminal affiliations. He was arrested with a bunch of MS13 gang members, wearing gang affiliation clothing and having gang tattoos - all strong indications that he is not the sort of immigrant we want in the US. When someone gets tattoos indicating membership in a gang, they are telling you who they are. You do not get gang tattoos lightly, because they make you a target for rival gangs, and if you wear them without belonging to that group you risk serious bodily harm or death from the gang themselves.\n\n\nAll of the above is why his application for legal status was denied - this despite being married to a US citizen and the denial was upheld on appeal. Only after his application for citizenship was denied did he request asylum, which for the record was not granted but a stay was placed on it. Said stay was rendered null and void. Null due to the excuse for the stay (if I go home to El Salvador the gangs will kill me - not a problem anymore). Void due to his choice of gang affiliation - MS13 is an international terrorist association, and no stay on deportation can be granted or maintained on any alien associated with that organization.",
