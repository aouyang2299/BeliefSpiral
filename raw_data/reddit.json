      "Interesting but super speculative. There are some differences in the cheeks but that would definitely be affected by gravity laying down vs walking. Without the pink marks, which I find a little distorting, the curvature of the ear in the dead photo looks the same to me, just maybe a little swollen, which would make sense.",
      "The part of his ear that looks smashed could be that way from pressure of a ligature from hanging for some time. The fact that after you die you no longer have healthy blood flow feeding your tissue means it will not return to ‚Äúnormal‚Äù until he would get in from of a mortician. It‚Äôs not uncommon for people to die with eyes open and they have to hold them shut. Mouths open and they have things to keep them closed. Hanging can cause ear deformity and jaw displacement. If you look at the nose and the brow line it‚Äôs obviously him. Now, whether he did this to himself? I don‚Äôt know. He may have just because he knew someone with more power would kill him or because of his own personal shame. Maybe it was prison conditions awaiting trial that made him do it? Idk. Maybe he didn‚Äôt do it himself either though. Those guards, oddly, say they slept or were online from what I remember but it‚Äôs been a while‚Ä¶ \n\n  I‚Äôve been to a regular jail and you have to go out so many times a day to be accounted for but there‚Äôs more than enough to hang yourself if you‚Äôre creative between those times. We were locked down 23hrs one hr rec time one hr in cell with a jail tablet. We could come out for 15min to eat 3 times a day too. If we were locked down or had a short staff that resulted in lockdown you took your food to your cell and had no rec time that day.",

      "Hide in plain sight",
      "The Rusty Shackleford channel that showed everything on the island, the FBI raid, and Epstein alive after he \"died\" was John McAfee's site, that was all his doing, he was operating the drones from his boat. The feds had that site removed from youtube after they killed McAfee, but there are said to exist downloaded backups.",

      "That's your own selection bias, you obviously don't look for those studies because thats not your angle on the pandemic. There are shitloads of studies on animal vectors and the arguments are sound whether COVID was man-made or not, its not like they would have found it was man-made and said \"welp now we don't need to understand how this interacts between species.\" COVID is still actively spreading through animals in America and that can be quite dangerous if not monitored.\n\n\"[Pangolins](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/veterinary-science/articles/10.3389/fvets.2020.596391/full)\n\nThe whole genome of pangolin-CoV isolated from Malayan pangolin (*Manis javanica*) was highly similar to that of the SARS-CoV-2 and bat CoV ([49](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/veterinary-science/articles/10.3389/fvets.2020.596391/full#B49)). But, the similarity between pangolin-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 was higher than that with the bat CoV ([50](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/veterinary-science/articles/10.3389/fvets.2020.596391/full#B50),¬†[51](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/veterinary-science/articles/10.3389/fvets.2020.596391/full#B51)). Moreover, pangolin CoVs shared 5 identical amino acids with SARS-CoV-2 whereas bat CoV RaTG13 only shared one amino acid with SARS-CoV-2 suggesting that pangolin could be a potential intermediate host that might mediate the cross-species transmission of SARS-CoV-2 ([20](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/veterinary-science/articles/10.3389/fvets.2020.596391/full#B20),¬†[52](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/veterinary-science/articles/10.3389/fvets.2020.596391/full#B52)). Furthermore, the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the pangolin-CoV was nearly identical to that of SARS-CoV-2 with a strong binding ability to human ACE2 indicating that pangolin was involved in the recombination of SARS-CoV-2 ([49](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/veterinary-science/articles/10.3389/fvets.2020.596391/full#B49)). However, the phylogenetic analyses support that SARS-CoV-2 did not arise directly from the pangolin-CoV ([52](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/veterinary-science/articles/10.3389/fvets.2020.596391/full#B52),¬†[53](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/veterinary-science/articles/10.3389/fvets.2020.596391/full#B53)). Therefore, it was suggested that SARS-CoV-2 originated in bats and transmitted to pangolin where recombination of pangolin-CoV and bat-CoV-RaTG13-like virus occurred. Then the recombined virus gets the ability to infect human cells ([12](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/veterinary-science/articles/10.3389/fvets.2020.596391/full#B12),¬†[20](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/veterinary-science/articles/10.3389/fvets.2020.596391/full#B20)).\"\n\nEDIT: Woah, the copy+paste took all the sources with it.
